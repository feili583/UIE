Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello



Petrel
0,1 PER

Sat , 18 Dec 2004 02:11:28 GMT



Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello
6,7 PER
6,7 PER

It has been suggested that there is , or was at one time , some sort of delegates ' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF . I do n't know if this is so , and I really think it 's sort of irrelevant .
17,18 PER|32,33 PER|42,43 ORG
17,18 PER|32,33 PER|42,43 ORG

It 's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the USCF .
11,12 PER|12,13 PER|18,19 PER|27,28 ORG
11,12 PER|12,13 PER|18,19 PER|27,28 ORG

Of course it 's in the bylaws that an active board member can not be given money by the USCF while on the board .
10,11 PER|11,12 PER|19,20 ORG|23,24 PER
10,11 PER|11,12 PER|19,20 ORG|23,24 PER

It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .
20,21 PER|21,22 PER|28,29 PER
20,21 PER|21,22 PER|28,29 PER

Suppose , for example , there were to be a proposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $ 10,000 upon the expiration of his / her term .
16,17 PER|17,18 PER
16,17 PER|17,18 PER

Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaws and would fail .



If the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .
2,3 PER
2,3 PER

Furthermore , it does n't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal EB meeting or not .
13,14 PER|30,31 PER
13,14 PER|30,31 PER

A board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the USCF , not feathering his / her nest , in the present or in the future .
1,2 PER|2,3 PER|7,8 PER|18,19 ORG
1,2 PER|2,3 PER|7,8 PER|18,19 ORG

If a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the bylaws , possibly endangers our tax - exempt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .
2,3 PER|3,4 PER
2,3 PER|3,4 PER

The purpose of having a " time limit " would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new EB that would consider the issues objectively .
52,53 PER|58,59 PER
52,53 PER|58,59 PER

Of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .
11,12 PER|20,21 PER|30,31 PER|39,40 PER
11,12 PER|20,21 PER|30,31 PER|39,40 PER

It would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it would n't automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation .
6,7 PER
6,7 PER

But this is neither here nor there , because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF 's new " move coordinator " , whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ED , means that at some level and in some form these discussions HAVE already taken place , while Marinello is serving as President .
12,14 PER|18,20 PER|22,23 ORG|27,28 PER|48,49 PER|67,68 PER|71,72 PER
12,14 PER|18,20 PER|22,23 ORG|27,28 PER|48,49 PER|67,68 PER|71,72 PER

I mean , it 's conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marinello 's absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities . So the ' time limit ' issue does n't even come up .
15,16 PER
15,16 PER

We pretty much know that Marinello , while on the board , has arranged to get future money from the USCF .
5,6 PER|10,11 PER|20,21 ORG
5,6 PER|10,11 PER|20,21 ORG

So we already have a problem .



If this is NOT a problem , I wish someone would explain to me why not .



Now , Stan B. argues that Marinello 's services are in fact indispensible as move coordinator , and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact , so that since we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain her .
2,4 PER|6,7 PER|15,16 PER|35,36 PER
2,4 PER|6,7 PER|15,16 PER|35,36 PER

I agree with the principle .



But I think that to make this argument work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS indispensible for this task .
10,11 PER|18,19 PER
10,11 PER|18,19 PER

This would have to include evidence that the EB had considered all the alternatives , including :
8,9 PER
8,9 PER

- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED , which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ED
8,9 PER|18,19 ORG|21,22 PER

Another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the USCF to talk about it , and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan , Larry Parr , and , I suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will obstruct the federation 's plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .

I 'm not entirely unsympathetic to this , actually .

But if we are going to talk about realism , here is another realistic concern : I predict that , if , in fact , the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true , and Marinello resigns as President and is hired as move coordinator , the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit ( or amend his current complaint ) charging the USCF EB members with self - dealing , violation of the USCF 's own bylaws , and every other thing , report us to the IRS , and demand that all USCF moneys which might be used to paid Marinello be frozen .

If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non - profit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the USCF , why would n't he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF 's violation of its own bylaws , which unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF ?

For an organization that is incorporated in Maryland and has its headquarters in Maryland , the laws of Maryland apply without regard to the states in which the directors live . Remember , a corporation is legally a " person " , distinct from the corporeal persons who govern , manage , and operate the corporation . Thus , the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person " lives " . --

In an April 30 , 2001 , Washington Times column , Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted " scant mention " to the " plain fact that it was Mr. Annan , when he was head of the United Nation 's peacekeeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994 .
