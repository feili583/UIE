i just want to update you on kofi annan ' s remarks .



the u . n . secretary - general did not answer questions on iraq as a result .



there ' s nothing to report on that front .



we have just gotten word from the ninth circuit court of appeals that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the pledge of allegiance in public classrooms .



schools in nine western states would have been prohibited from having students say the pledge starting monday .



the stay was granted to give the school districts involved in the initial cases 90 days to appeal to the u . s . supreme court here in washington .

As far as state laws go , you must follow the laws for the states ( 1 ) in which the organization is incorporated and ( 2 ) in which the organization operates .



For an organization that is incorporated in Maryland and has its headquarters in Maryland , the laws of Maryland apply without regard to the states in which the directors live .



Remember , a corporation is legally a " person ", distinct from the corporeal persons who govern , manage , and operate the corporation .



Thus , the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person " lives ".

Actually , it would not be advisable to accept Freddy ' s comments at face value .



It is not acceptable policy and not legal to pay an honorarium or stipend to directors of charities .



I checked with a lawyer familiar with Canadian charity law , who explained that it is not permitted to remunerate board members of charities for their service as board members .



The prohibition does not apply to directors of nonprofit organizations that are not charities .



In the USA , the rules vary from state to state .



Some states permit board members of charities to be compensated , but it is generally not done .



Donors , funders , and the general public share the view that directors of charities should act gratuitiously .



It is permitted everywhere , however , to reimburse directors for necessary expenses incurred in order to serve .



If your organization is a charity , you need to check your state law and act very carefully if you are considering paying board members .

Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello
5,6 Personnel:Start-Position|5,7 Person
5,6 Personnel:Start-Position|5,7 Person

It has been suggested that there is , or was at one time , some sort of delegates ' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF .
30,31 Personnel:End-Position|28,31 Person|39,40 Personnel:Start-Position|36,40 Person|39,43 Entity
30,31 Personnel:End-Position|28,31 Person|39,40 Personnel:Start-Position|36,40 Person|39,43 Entity

I don ' t know if this is so , and I really think it ' s sort of irrelevant .



It ' s irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the USCF .
24,25 Transaction:Transfer-Money|24,29 Giver|13,25 Recipient
24,25 Transaction:Transfer-Money|24,29 Giver|13,25 Recipient

Of course it ' s in the bylaws that an active board member cannot be given money by the USCF while on the board .
15,16 Transaction:Transfer-Money|15,20 Giver|12,16 Recipient
15,16 Transaction:Transfer-Money|15,20 Giver|12,16 Recipient

It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .
23,24 Transaction:Transfer-Money|21,24 Recipient|26,27 Personnel:End-Position|21,27 Person
23,24 Transaction:Transfer-Money|21,24 Recipient|26,27 Personnel:End-Position|21,27 Person

Suppose , for example , there were to be a proposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $ 10 , 000 upon the expiration of his / her term .
20,21 Transaction:Transfer-Money|17,21 Beneficiary|27,28 Personnel:End-Position|27,30 Person|27,32 Person
20,21 Transaction:Transfer-Money|17,21 Beneficiary|27,28 Personnel:End-Position|27,30 Person|27,32 Person

Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaws and would fail .



If the board cannot vote to give themselves present money , they cannot vote to give themselves future money either .
6,7 Transaction:Transfer-Money|2,7 Giver|6,8 Recipient|15,16 Transaction:Transfer-Money|11,16 Giver|15,17 Recipient
6,7 Transaction:Transfer-Money|2,7 Giver|6,8 Recipient|15,16 Transaction:Transfer-Money|11,16 Giver|15,17 Recipient

Furthermore , it doesn ' t matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal EB meeting or not .
32,33 Contact:Meet|31,33 Entity
32,33 Contact:Meet|31,33 Entity

A board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the USCF , not feathering his / her nest , in the present or in the future .
21,22 Transaction:Transfer-Money|21,23 Recipient|2,22 Giver|21,25 Recipient
21,22 Transaction:Transfer-Money|21,23 Recipient|2,22 Giver|21,25 Recipient

If a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the bylaws , possibly endangers our tax - exempt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .
6,7 Transaction:Transfer-Money|3,7 Recipient
6,7 Transaction:Transfer-Money|3,7 Recipient

The purpose of having a " time limit " would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new EB that would consider the issues objectively .
55,56 Personnel:Elect|55,59 Person|52,56 Entity
55,56 Personnel:Elect|55,59 Person|52,56 Entity

Of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board - without - ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .
9,10 Personnel:End-Position|7,10 Person|19,20 Transaction:Transfer-Money|19,23 Giver|7,20 Recipient|39,40 Personnel:Start-Position|39,42 Person
9,10 Personnel:End-Position|7,10 Person|19,20 Transaction:Transfer-Money|19,23 Giver|7,20 Recipient|39,40 Personnel:Start-Position|39,42 Person

It would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it wouldn ' t automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation .



But this is neither here nor there , because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF ' s new " move coordinator ", whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim E D , means that at some level and in some form these discussions HAVE already taken place , while Marinello is serving as President .
25,26 Personnel:Start-Position|18,26 Person|19,26 Person|22,26 Entity
25,26 Personnel:Start-Position|18,26 Person|22,26 Entity

I mean , it ' s conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marinello ' s absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities .
21,22 Personnel:Start-Position|21,23 Person|48,50 Personnel:End-Position|47,49 Person|47,50 Person
21,22 Personnel:Start-Position|21,23 Person|48,50 Personnel:End-Position|47,50 Person

So the ' time limit ' issue doesn ' t even come up .



We pretty much know that Marinello , while on the board , has arranged to get future money from the USCF .
15,16 Transaction:Transfer-Money|15,21 Giver|5,16 Recipient
15,16 Transaction:Transfer-Money|15,21 Giver|5,16 Recipient

So we already have a problem .



If this is NOT a problem , I wish someone would explain to me why not .



Now , Stan B . argues that Marinello ' s services are in fact indispensible as move coordinator , and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact , so that since we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain her .



I agree with the principle .



But I think that to make this argument work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS indispensible for this task .



This would have to include evidence that the EB had considered all the alternatives , including :



- delegating the whole thing to the Interim E D , which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ED



- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to act as move coordinator
6,7 Personnel:Start-Position|6,8 Person
6,7 Personnel:Start-Position|6,8 Person

- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job ( there are such people )
6,7 Personnel:Start-Position|6,10 Person
6,7 Personnel:Start-Position|6,10 Person

- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon



If they did consider alternatives , it would also have to include evidence that Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other people , or is willing to do the job cheaper ( although this wouldn ' t constitute being " indispensible " in my view ).



If , however , they just looked around the room and said " who is going to manage this ?"



and someone said , " Beatriz , how about you ?



", this does not constitute proof that her services are indispensible , and thus it wouldn ' t interfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a bylaws violation .



One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler , which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones , was that since this board was elected , we should let them do as they please .
28,29 Personnel:Elect|26,29 Person
28,29 Personnel:Elect|26,29 Person

Which is to say that there might as well not be bylaws , ethics standards , laws , etc ., since an elected board is not bound by any of them .
22,23 Personnel:Elect|22,24 Person
22,23 Personnel:Elect|22,24 Person

I think this idea should be rejected .



Another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the USCF to talk about it , and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan , Larry Parr , and , I suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will obstruct the federation ' s plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .
96,97 Transaction:Transfer-Money|96,98 Recipient|93,97 Giver
96,97 Transaction:Transfer-Money|96,98 Recipient|93,97 Giver

So we should all ignore this because it is realistic to do so .



I ' m not entirely unsympathetic to this , actually .



But frankly I think that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have had to do with well - intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them out in the open would harm the USCF , and as a result we have awful habits which hurt the USCF even worse .



But if we are going to talk about realism , here is another realistic concern : I predict that , if , in fact , the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true , and Marinello resigns as President and is hired as move coordinator , the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit ( or amend his current complaint ) charging the USCF EB members with self - dealing , violation of the USCF ' s own bylaws , and every other thing , report us to the IRS , and demand that all USCF moneys which might be used to paid Marinello be frozen .
33,34 Contact:Meet|32,34 Place|39,40 Personnel:End-Position|38,40 Person|32,40 Place|44,45 Personnel:Start-Position|38,45 Person|32,45 Place|44,86 Entity|61,62 Justice:Sue|61,74 Defendant|56,62 Plaintiff|57,62 Plaintiff|67,68 Justice:Sue|65,68 Plaintiff|69,70 Justice:Charge-Indict|69,74 Defendant|56,70 Prosecutor|57,70 Prosecutor|110,111 Transaction:Transfer-Money|103,111 Giver|110,112 Recipient

This is not based on any communication from Sam , direct or indirect .



It is just logical .



If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non - profit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the USCF , why wouldn ' t he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF ' s violation of its own bylaws , which unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF ?
7,8 Justice:Sue|7,30 Defendant|7,13 Place|7,14 Place|1,8 Plaintiff|38,39 Justice:Sue|38,45 Defendant|35,39 Plaintiff
7,8 Justice:Sue|7,30 Defendant|7,14 Place|1,8 Plaintiff|38,39 Justice:Sue|38,45 Defendant|35,39 Plaintiff

I wrote a few days ago quoting my own employer association ' s attorney , who said that courts mostly let associations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws .



It is irritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan ; imagine how irritating it would be to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have done something so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him .

Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqi aircraft , and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery .



( on camera ): Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq ?



UNIDENTIFIED MALE



No , because I am in an area which I don ' t know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane , by the time I get out of the airplane I ' m thinking the same way .



TUCHMAN



Which is ?



UNIDENTIFIED MALE



The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up , then something ' s going wrong .



TUCHMAN ( voice - over )



As a precaution , the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do .



Ultimately it ' s discovered the targets are U . S . combat helicopters .



Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling .



Watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane ' s fuel line connects with the chopper .



Both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land .



At times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper ' s rotor blades getting closer .



Looking with the naked eye out of the plane , the helicopter is impossible to see .



The pitch - black maneuver ends after 10 minutes .



( on camera ): What stops though - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at aircraft all throughout this war .

We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down .



We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down .



( voice - over ): But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes for a different reason .



They are the Pararescue jumpers , or PJs who jump off the plane for rescue missions .



UNIDENTIFIED MALE



I mean it ' s probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment .

No rescues were necessary on this sortie .

This is a very busy base .



We want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings .



It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and this is what it ' s been like for the past 11 days .



We have just watched multitudes of warplanes land , multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign .



They ' re expecting a total at this particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24 - hour period ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the Middle East according to the Pentagon .



They ' re saying there will be 1500 sorties in a 24 - hour period ending tomorrow .



Eight hundred of those sorties will be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq .

Do you know when this place was last used ?



I mean do you know ( UNINTELLIGIBLE )



BANHAM



I ' m not too sure but judging by some of this , it ' s been here quite a long time so whether it ' s been used recently by them - there was an Intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them .



MILAM



Grenades , mortars , all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers but there for the taking .



The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them .



Some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot .



The rest is carried way out into the desert .



And today ' s parts in this conflict , this kind of work becomes more and more important .



With the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them .



CAPTAIN ANDY GOOCH , ROYAL ENGINEERS



With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about , if they ' d used those systems , that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions .

With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do .



No one in the British forces here is willing to take any risks .

John , they have to be happy there .

People in Baghdad celebrating .



U . S . troops assisting in pulling down that statue of Saddam Hussein .



Across the Arab world , the administration hopes to send a signal that the United States is there to help the Iraqi people regain control of their own country , as a liberty , not as any imperial or occupying force .



Of course , at the same time , though , the White House worries that the American people might see these pictures and think the war is over .

They are civilians from the U . S . government .

And beginning as early as next week , there will be a series of town meetings , if you will .

The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks .



They are trying to identify Iraqis from within the country , as well as Iraqi dissidents and exiles , the diaspora they call it here at the White House , who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say it could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that interim Iraqi authority .



Now , we know , one person who will be invited is planning process , those planning meetings , is Ahmed Chalabi .

But I also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the White House , even among some of Mr .

As of an hour or so ago , we got word from the battlefield that U . S . forces were just 15 miles away from the southern edge of Baghdad .



And they may be even closer right now .



The toughest fight , though , may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital .

Gotta hate the French , I really don ' t think there is anything good you can say about the French anymore , they are a waste and a joke of a government .



Apparently Bush wants the European ' s to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist group .



Makes sense right ?



As rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the Middle East , the Bush administration is arguing with European governments over whether they should designate the Lebanon - based Shiite group Hezbollah a terrorist organization , American and European officials say .



The United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria , Hezbollah ' s main sponsors .



The American rift with Syria deepened this week , with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon ' s former prime minister in Beirut on Monday .

...



In the past two weeks , the officials said , France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups .

42,44 Transaction:Transfer-Money|40,44 Beneficiary|42,46 Place|42,49 Recipient

The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization , but the French , American and European officials said , have opposed doing so , and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise , given the new turbulence in Lebanon .
41,42 Conflict:Attack|41,44 Place
41,42 Conflict:Attack|41,44 Place

Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , has told them that he , too , regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East , one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis .

37,38 Contact:Meet|43,44 Conflict:Attack|41,44 Attacker|29,44 Place|43,45 Target

Gotta love that .



The Palestinian president admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f - wad terrorists but the French don ' t agree .... No joke .



The Europeans are not solidly opposed to listing Hezbollah as a terrorist group , the officials said .



The Netherlands , Italy and Poland support the Bush administration ' s view , several officials said , while Germany and Britain believe the issue is moot unless the French change their minds .



One European diplomat said other countries were " hiding behind " France on the issue .



...



A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House , a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe .
20,21 Contact:Meet|15,21 Place|20,24 Entity|20,25 Entity|33,34 Contact:Meet|27,34 Entity
20,21 Contact:Meet|15,21 Place|20,25 Entity|33,34 Contact:Meet|27,34 Entity

The group could reach no consensus , the diplomat said .



" Nothing is going to change on Hezbollah because we don ' t have an agreement among the member states ," the diplomat said .



" That doesn ' t mean we won ' t get a consensus .



I know the Americans are impatient , but the European Union has 25 states , and these things take time ."



Some of those interviewed tried to make it sound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush is because of the situation in Lebanon .



But as The Captain points out , it probably has more to do with Iran :



I suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the " delicate " nature of Lebanese politics , but from the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranians .



The EU has tried for the past two years to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up their nuclear - weapons ambitions to little avail .



They don ' t want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs ' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly .

Our offices are in one of the patio homes , and I have my own lovely office with a window .



The job ' s only about 12 miles from home , and I ' m going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and afternoons .



It all seems perfect and yet ... Oh , I ' m so thankful to be somewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people ' s lives , and I want to keep an open mind and hope it ' ll last forever , but I have a feeling I ' ll be restless within a year or so .



My boss is a very nice person , but conservative and resistant to technology , i . e .



computers , internet , etc .



We just got new computers a week and half ago , and she ' s griping about XP ( her old OS was Windows 98 -- mine was 95 , so I ' m thrilled with the new stuff ).



I tell her it ' ll just take some getting used to .



We ' ll see .



I ' m not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get , but it ' s the best salary I ' ve gotten thus far .



When I was fulltime in radio I made a little less , but I got quite a few remotes , which make up for not getting a topnotch salary .



I ' m still doing my TV announcing and my weekend radio stuff , so that money will help .



I ' m going to start actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so , too .



My plan is to pay off my car early , and then work on the other debts .

I think it ' s time to go on and fill out the adoption applications .



I ' m terrified of more debt , but Mom and Dad will help with the money .



I ' m not sure they realize how expensive it all is .



I ' m thinking we might lean toward adopting from Guatemala , but we ' ve still not hashed it all out .



It ' s almost bad making some money now , because while most of me wants to save as much as possible , the other , smaller part is screaming loudly for stuff , stuff , stuff !!!



I ' ve got a trial subscription to XM at work because of the Dell computers , and now I ' m lusting to have it all of the time .



G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an aux jack , so I could listen to it here .



He asked if I wanted a car stereo , and I said no , but I do .



There are so many things I want .



A garage .



A dining room set .



New stuff for our house .



New clothes .



New everything .



But I want family more .



I think part of the draw of the other stuff is I could get it now .



But I ' d be paying for it later .



Money makes the world go round and round and round til I ' m just dizzy .

Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday .



It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro - united nations that its almost sickening to read .

( hat tip Clear and Present )



One of the hottest stories around , the U . N . corruption scandal , NBC has been out to lunch .



Why ?



Its U . N . reporter has been on the payroll of the U . N . lobby .
10,11 Transaction:Transfer-Money|10,18 Giver|5,11 Recipient
10,11 Transaction:Transfer-Money|10,18 Giver|5,11 Recipient

Linda Fasulo , the U . N . correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC , has written a pro - U . N . book , An Insider ' s Guide to the U . N . , which reads like the U . N . paid for it .

Actually , the pro - U . N . lobby paid for it .
10,11 Transaction:Transfer-Money|9,11 Giver
10,11 Transaction:Transfer-Money|9,11 Giver

In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter , Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner ' s U . N . Foundation and Better World Campaign for " their generous financial support " of her book project .
33,34 Transaction:Transfer-Money|19,34 Giver|20,34 Giver|21,34 Giver|22,34 Giver|23,34 Giver|25,34 Giver|26,34 Giver|27,34 Giver|11,34 Recipient

She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund " for helping to fund the project ."

11,12 Transaction:Transfer-Money|4,12 Giver|0,12 Recipient

The book is about " one of the finest and most important governing bodies ," she says .



Of the U . N . chief , she writes like a school girl with a crush .



" It is hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of [ Kofi ] Annan ' s performance as Secretary General ," she claims .



His performance is so " impressive " that she wonders if a " cult of personality " has risen up around him .



One U . S . official is reported to be " astonished by just how good a Secretary General Kofi Annan has been ."



Yup , you read that right .



Kofi ' s performance is soooooo impressive .



Gag .



Guess the democrats have their own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with .



Why would an NBC reporter ( who also reports on the U . N . for National Public Radio ) take money from the U . N . lobby ?

Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA - USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner .

31,32 Contact:Meet|6,32 Entity|15,32 Entity|19,32 Entity

Not surprisingly , Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as saying it is a " must - read ."



Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette , former New York Times bureau chief at the U . N . who now writes for U . N . Wire , a Ted Turner - funded online news service that covers the U . N . A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan ' s role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .

She admits , however , that , " The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U . N .

10,11 Conflict:Attack|9,11 Place

Undersecretary General for peacekeeping ," and that " After he became SG [ Secretary General ], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies ."



Later , " Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly ," she writes .



But responsibility for what ?



The truth is that , as director of U . N . peacekeeping , Annan personally refused requests to authorize U . N . peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide .

Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , Major General Romeo Dallaire , the commander of several thousand U . N . troops in Rwanda , sent a fax to Kofi Annan ' s office , saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned .

All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family .



But the general needed U . N . authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives .



He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now - infamous " genocide fax " from Annan ' s office .

The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place .

What a great guy he is isn ' t he .



Or how about the ongoing prostitution that ' s going on in the Congo ?



Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal .



Yeah ... this guy is such a good SG .



Eff him .



The article ends with the following :



In an April 30 , 2001 , Washington Times column , Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted " scant mention " to the " plain fact that it was Mr . Annan , when he was head of the United Nation ' s peacekeeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800 , 000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994 ."

30,31 Conflict:Attack|26,31 Attacker
30,31 Conflict:Attack|26,31 Attacker

But for five and a half years , he noted , Annan " refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr . Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5 , 000 U . N . troops could have stopped the killings if Mr . Annan had not closed his eyes ."

From Reuters : U . S . Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair - trigger circumstances .

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn ' t see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city .

" You can ' t trust these people .



He should not be investigated .



He did nothing wrong ."



Of course the anti - American world press is jumping all over this story , casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby - trapped with explosives .

NEW YORK , March 19 ( AFP )



Media tycoon Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi Universal Entertainment , the entertainment unit of French giant Vivendi Universal whose future appears up for grabs .

In a statement , Diller -- who took on the " provisional " role at the top of Vivendi ' s US entertainment operations in December -- said his USA Interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of Vivendi Universal Entertainment .

" My executive role was never intended to be permanent ," said Diller .



" Now that Vivendi Universal has begun a formal process in reviewing options for its entertainment assets , it is appropriate to step aside from any direct management responsibility ."



As part of the 11 - billion - dollar sale of USA Interactive ' s film and television operations to the French media company in December 2001 , USA Interactive received 2 . 5 billion dollars in preferred shares in Vivendi Universal Entertainment .

Diller , 60 , personally received a 1 . 5 percent stake in the business and had been touted as a likely candidate to run Vivendi Universal ' s entertainment unit in the United States if the troubled French media giant were broken up .



In Paris , the French media group said parent company chairman Jean - Rene Fourtou will replace Diller as chairman and chief executive of US unit .

Vivendi Universal , the world ' s second - largest media group after AOL Time Warner of the United States , has been digging out from under a mountain of debt since the removal of expansionist boss Jean - Marie Messier last July , largely through asset sales .

Vivendi Universal earlier this month posted a record net loss of 23 . 3 billion euros ( 25 . 6 billion dollars ) for 2002 .



Faced with debt of 35 billion euros ( 37 billion dollars ) in June last year -- including 19 billion from the media and telecoms division alone -- the sprawling conglomerate has set a target of reducing its debt by 16 billion euros by end - 2004 .



Speculation has been rife that troubled Vivendi has been weighing a spinoff or sale of its US film , television and theme park operations as part of its restructuring .
13,14 Transaction:Transfer-Ownership|13,24 Artifact|6,14 Seller
13,14 Transaction:Transfer-Ownership|13,24 Artifact|6,14 Seller

Press speculation had already suggested that Vivendi might decide to keep its Universal Music division , while either divesting or inviting third parties to take a minority stake in the remaining Entertainment assets .



Earlier this month , sources told Agence France Presse financial news unit AFX that Viacom is studying a bid for Vivendi ' s US entertainment assets placing it as a serious rival squarely in the running against oil billionaire Marvin Davis who has bid 20 billion dollars for the operations .



While other media companies like Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer , Liberty Media Corp , News Corp and General Electric Co ' s NBC have been mentioned as potential bidders for the Vivendi operations , Viacom is one of the few media companies with a balance sheet healthy enough to mount a bid .



HAIFA , Israel , March 5 ( AFP ) - Fifteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded Wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on a student bus in the northern town of Haifa , the first bombing in Israel in exactly two months .

At the last minute , Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the campaign was " ahead of schedule ."

The tests were designed to sway six uncommitted council members behind a draft resolution which would declare that Iraq has missed its last chance to disarm peacefully unless the council decides otherwise by Monday .



The two allies would not push for a vote Friday on the draft resolution , diplomats at the United Nations said , while US Secretary of State Colin Powell hinted that Washington would consider not even putting the text to a vote .



" We are still talking to the members of the council with respect to coalescing around a position that wouldn ' t draw a veto , but the options remain : go for a vote and see what members say , or not go for a vote ," Powell said .

France has provoked Washington ' s ire in its steadfast insistence that it will veto any resolution paving the way for war , even rejecting the British proposals for concrete tests before Baghdad had done so .



France ' s threat to cast its veto was only making war more likely , British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said .



" Unfortunately they appear to have made the decision not to enforce ( UN resolution ) 1441 ," Straw told Britain ' s The Guardian newspaper .



" That renders it less likely that we get a peaceful outcome ."



Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov said the US decision to drop demands for a Security Council vote this week on war with Iraq showed the resolution had not won enough support .



He rejected the British proposals , saying : " The British proposals on Iraq are not constructive and do not resolve the key problem , the prevention of a military scenario involving Baghdad ," the Interfax news agency reported .



He repeated that Moscow would not back a resolution that authorised an attack against Iraq : " It is not necessary now to adopt any new resolution on Iraq , especially resolutions which lead to war ."

His comments were echoed by the German ambassador to the UN , Gunter Pleuger , who said : " There is no majority support for the British proposal ."



In Germany , Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that weapons inspectors had to be allowed to continue their work .



" Together with our friends in France , with Russia , China and the majority of the security council we are confident the disarmament of Iraq can be achieved through peaceful means ," Schroeder said .



The British - US proposal needs nine votes to pass through the 15 - member Security Council -- a feat looking increasingly unlikely with France and Russia vowing to veto the resolution and Syria , China and Germany all opposing .



The United States meanwhile deployed its B - 2 stealth bombers to positions closer to Iraq and ordered as many as 15 warships capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles to the Red Sea from the Mediterranean , US officials said .
