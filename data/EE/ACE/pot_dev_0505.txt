BEGALA Bob , one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world do n't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration .

But what we just learned this week from " Newsweek " magazine which got a hold of the debriefings , is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995 .



Why has n't our president told us that ?



Why do we have to learn it from " Newsweek " ?



DORNAN I do n't believe that he believed it was all destroyed .



The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father - in - law kill him shows he was n't the most stable of people .



But the things that ...



BEGALA Good point .



But should n't our president have told us what the CIA told him .



Why do we learn from " Newsweek?"Should he level with us ?



DORNAN Paul , look , the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates war . Any rational person hates war .



Bush is n't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men .

NOVAK Tom Andrews , I think we all realize that a government does n't go to war a nation goes to war .



And so I would like you to take a look at the CNN/"USA TODAY" / Gallup poll , taken last week , should U.S. troops to go to Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power .

ANDREWS Now , Bob , come on you do n't really buy this .



I mean , listen , this is the oldest trick in the book .



You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head .



But , ask them another question , ask them what they think about spending $ 1.3 trillion in destroying this economy .



Ask them about going and not just a war , Bob , but an invasion and occupying for up to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most distable and volatile regions in the world .
37,41 PART-WHOLE.Geographical
37,41 PART-WHOLE.Geographical

Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down .



Well , I 've seen some of the figures .



Once you start telling Americans the story , -- the administration refuse today tell us story .



They 're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are , what the costs are , how many years we might be in , the possibility of us getting bogged down , because what Americans know that , they 're opposed to this war .



The more they learn about this invasion , the more they learn about this occupation , the less they support it .



DORNAN Tom , you know what liberals want .



They do n't want a smoking gun , they want a smoking city .



The Clinton people all say ...



BEGALA That 's going to have to be last war , unfair and unfortunate as that is , I am sorry , they 're telling us we 're out of time .

TUCHMAN Which is ?



UNIDENTIFIED MALE The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up , then something 's going wrong .

They have n't hit anybody , but is n't it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you .



UNIDENTIFIED MALE Again , we know where we 're going .



We know where they 're at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us , we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition .



TUCHMAN We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down .



We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down .

TUCHMAN No rescues were necessary on this sortie .



The plane arrived back to base safely .



( on camera ) : Do you have any fear ?



UNIDENTIFIED MALE Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it 's a good thing in this circumstance .



TUCHMAN ( voice - over ) This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours .

U.S. Forces Hunt for Last of Saddam 's Loyal Fighters



WOODRUFF You are looking at live pictures of the White House where President Bush watched some of the television coverage of events in Baghdad today . Separately , Vice President Cheney shared his thoughts in a speech in New Orleans .

JOHN KING , CNN SNR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Judy , they are .



Behind the scenes privately here you get a palpable sense of vindication , although publicly caution is the watchword here , administration officials from the vice president on down saying the war is not over yet .

Of course , at the same time , though , the White House worries that the American people might see these pictures and think the war is over .

The vice president made that argument today .



But even as he sounds that note of caution , you do sense a little tiny bit of we told you so .



( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )



DICK CHENEY , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Bottom line , with less than half of the ground forces and two - thirds of the air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm , Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective .



Yet until this war is fully won , we can not be overconfident in our position .



And we must not underestimate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal to the dictator .

KING We will not hear from the president today , we are told , but before the week is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the president is likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead .



So , again , behind the scenes , a sense of vindication , but also a cautious attitude because of the fighting still to come .



I have to tell you , though , Judy , the CIA Director George Tenet walked out of the White House a short time ago with a giant smile on his face .

The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks .



They are trying to identify Iraqis from within the country , as well as Iraqi dissidents and exiles , the diaspora they call it here at the White House , who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say it could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that interim Iraqi authority .

He is known to be a favorite of Vice President Dick Cheney , of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rumsfeld 's top deputy , Paul Wolfowitz .



He will be involved in the planning and in those meetings .



But I also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the White House , even among some of Mr. Chalabi 's top supporters , that , since returning to Iraq in recent days , he has complained frequently , including on our air earlier today , that the United States is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction efforts , to restore electricity and restore water .



Over at the Pentagon today , Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , again , a supporter of Mr. Chalabi , said that , in his view , services were already at their prewar levels .



And Mr. Rumsfeld went on to say , Secretary Rumsfeld went on to say , there is still a war going on , still quite a dangerous situation -- Judy .



WOODRUFF Yes , we caught some of that irritation in his choice .



All right , John King , our senior White House correspondent , thank you .

Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello

Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello



It has been suggested that there is , or was at one time , some sort of delegates ' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF . I do n't know if this is so , and I really think it 's sort of irrelevant .



It 's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the USCF .
11,13 PER-SOC.Business|12,28 ORG-AFF.Employment
11,13 PER-SOC.Business|12,28 ORG-AFF.Employment

Of course it 's in the bylaws that an active board member can not be given money by the USCF while on the board .
10,12 PER-SOC.Business
10,12 PER-SOC.Business

It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .
20,22 PER-SOC.Business
20,22 PER-SOC.Business

Suppose , for example , there were to be a proposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $ 10,000 upon the expiration of his / her term .
16,18 PER-SOC.Business
16,18 PER-SOC.Business

Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaws and would fail .



If the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .



Furthermore , it does n't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal EB meeting or not .



A board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the USCF , not feathering his / her nest , in the present or in the future .
1,3 PER-SOC.Business|2,19 ORG-AFF.Membership
1,3 PER-SOC.Business|2,19 ORG-AFF.Membership

If a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the bylaws , possibly endangers our tax - exempt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .
2,4 PER-SOC.Business
2,4 PER-SOC.Business

The purpose of having a " time limit " would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new EB that would consider the issues objectively .



Of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .



It would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it would n't automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation .



But this is neither here nor there , because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF 's new " move coordinator " , whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ED , means that at some level and in some form these discussions HAVE already taken place , while Marinello is serving as President .
22,28 ORG-AFF.Employment
22,28 ORG-AFF.Employment

I mean , it 's conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marinello 's absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities . So the ' time limit ' issue does n't even come up .



We pretty much know that Marinello , while on the board , has arranged to get future money from the USCF .
5,11 PER-SOC.Business
5,11 PER-SOC.Business

So we already have a problem .



If this is NOT a problem , I wish someone would explain to me why not .



Now , Stan B. argues that Marinello 's services are in fact indispensible as move coordinator , and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact , so that since we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain her .



I agree with the principle .



But I think that to make this argument work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS indispensible for this task .



This would have to include evidence that the EB had considered all the alternatives , including :



- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED , which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ED
18,22 ORG-AFF.Membership
18,22 ORG-AFF.Membership

- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to act as move coordinator
10,13 PHYS.Located|11,13 PHYS.Located
10,13 PHYS.Located

- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job ( there are such people )
4,10 PER-SOC.Business|9,14 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer
4,10 PER-SOC.Business|9,14 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer

- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon



If they did consider alternatives , it would also have to include evidence that Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other people , or is willing to do the job cheaper ( although this would n't constitute being " indispensible " in my view ) .
14,22 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer
14,22 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer

If , however , they just looked around the room and said " who is going to manage this ? " and someone said , " Beatriz , how about you ? " , this does not constitute proof that her services are indispensible , and thus it would n't interfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a bylaws violation .



One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler , which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones , was that since this board was elected , we should let them do as they please .



Which is to say that there might as well not be bylaws , ethics standards , laws , etc . , since an elected board is not bound by any of them .



I think this idea should be rejected .



Another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the USCF to talk about it , and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan , Larry Parr , and , I suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will obstruct the federation 's plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .



So we should all ignore this because it is realistic to do so .



I 'm not entirely unsympathetic to this , actually .



But frankly I think that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have had to do with well - intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them out in the open would harm the USCF , and as a result we have awful habits which hurt the USCF even worse .



But if we are going to talk about realism , here is another realistic concern : I predict that , if , in fact , the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true , and Marinello resigns as President and is hired as move coordinator , the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit ( or amend his current complaint ) charging the USCF EB members with self - dealing , violation of the USCF 's own bylaws , and every other thing , report us to the IRS , and demand that all USCF moneys which might be used to paid Marinello be frozen .
71,73 ORG-AFF.Membership|72,74 PER-SOC.Business
71,73 ORG-AFF.Membership|72,74 PER-SOC.Business

This is not based on any communication from Sam , direct or indirect .



It is just logical .



If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non - profit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the USCF , why would n't he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF 's violation of its own bylaws , which unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF ?
12,18 GEN-AFF.Org-Location|13,18 GEN-AFF.Org-Location
12,18 GEN-AFF.Org-Location

I wrote a few days ago quoting my own employer association 's attorney , who said that courts mostly let associations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws .
9,11 ORG-AFF.Membership|10,13 ORG-AFF.Employment
9,11 ORG-AFF.Membership|10,13 ORG-AFF.Employment

It is irritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan ; imagine how irritating it would be to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have done something so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him .

Re : Board Member Compensation



In IRS Publication 557 , the sample draft articles of incorporation indicate that NO compensation may be paid to directors .



In fairness , reimbursement of out - of - pocket expenses on behalf of the organization -- including travel and lodging to attend board meetings -- are allowed .
15,24 ORG-AFF.Membership
15,24 ORG-AFF.Membership

However , Publication 557 does not explicitly prohibit compensation to directors .



As far as state laws go , you must follow the laws for the states ( 1 ) in which the organization is incorporated and ( 2 ) in which the organization operates .



For an organization that is incorporated in Maryland and has its headquarters in Maryland , the laws of Maryland apply without regard to the states in which the directors live . Remember , a corporation is legally a " person " , distinct from the corporeal persons who govern , manage , and operate the corporation . Thus , the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the state where that person " lives " . --

In the past two weeks , the officials said , France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister , Silvan Shalom , to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups .

" Some of those interviewed tried to make it sound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush is because of the situation in Lebanon .



But as The Captain points out , it probably has more to do with Iran :



I suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the " delicate " nature of Lebanese politics , but from the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranians .



The EU has tried for the past two years to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up their nuclear - weapons ambitions to little avail .

Get Off Their Backs



Scott



2004 - 11 - 16T13:47:00 From Reuters : U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair - trigger circumstances .
8,10 ORG-AFF.Employment|13,26 PHYS.Located|20,26 PHYS.Located
8,10 ORG-AFF.Employment|13,26 PHYS.Located|20,26 PHYS.Located

Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they did n't see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city .



" I can see why he would do it .



He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja .



There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances , " said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson .



" I would have shot the insurgent too .



Two shots to the head , " said Sergeant Nicholas Graham , 24 , of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .

" You ca n't trust these people .



He should not be investigated .



He did nothing wrong .



" Of course the anti - American world press is jumping all over this story , casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby - trapped with explosives .



Add the tactic of booby - trapping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings , and it 's clear to say that the Geneva Convention is n't on the minds of the insurgents .



For that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush .



I 'm no fan of this war either , but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones from their comfortable recliners .



To the world press and everyone else who despises the United States : You do n't have to like our president or those operating this war , but get off the backs of the 18 , 19 and 20 year - olds thrown into a situation you will never see or have to encounter .



I 've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well , and I will support them at every opportunity .

Liberal Reporter Taking Kickbacks



Curt



2005 - 02 - 03T19:53:00 Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday .



It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro - united nations that its almost sickening to read .
6,9 ORG-AFF.Employment
6,9 ORG-AFF.Employment

( hat tip Clear and Present )



One of the hottest stories around , the U.N. corruption scandal , NBC has been out to lunch .



Why ?



Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby .
2,12 PER-SOC.Business
2,12 PER-SOC.Business

Linda Fasulo , the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC , has written a pro - U.N. book , An Insider 's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it .
5,8 ORG-AFF.Employment|5,11 ORG-AFF.Employment
5,8 ORG-AFF.Employment|5,11 ORG-AFF.Employment

Actually , the pro - U.N. lobby paid for it .



In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter , Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner 's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for " their generous financial support " of her book project .
15,19 ORG-AFF.Founder|15,20 ORG-AFF.Founder|16,19 ORG-AFF.Founder|16,20 ORG-AFF.Founder
15,20 ORG-AFF.Founder

She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund " for helping to fund the project . " The book is about " one of the finest and most important governing bodies , " she says .



Of the U.N. chief , she writes like a school girl with a crush .
2,4 ORG-AFF.Employment
2,4 ORG-AFF.Employment

" It is hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of [ Kofi ] Annan 's performance as Secretary General , " she claims .



His performance is so " impressive " that she wonders if a " cult of personality " has risen up around him .



One U.S. official is reported to be " astonished by just how good a Secretary General Kofi Annan has been .
1,3 ORG-AFF.Employment
1,3 ORG-AFF.Employment

" Yup , you read that right .



Kofi 's performance is soooooo impressive .



Gag .



Guess the democrats have their own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with .



Why would an NBC reporter ( who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio ) take money from the U.N. lobby ?
3,5 ORG-AFF.Employment
3,5 ORG-AFF.Employment

Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA - USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner .
3,6 ORG-AFF.Employment
3,6 ORG-AFF.Employment

Not surprisingly , Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as saying it is a " must - read .



" Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette , former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire , a Ted Turner - funded online news service that covers the U.N. A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan 's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
28,35 ORG-AFF.Investor-Shareholder|29,35 ORG-AFF.Investor-Shareholder
28,35 ORG-AFF.Investor-Shareholder

She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it .
8,12 ORG-AFF.Membership|8,13 ORG-AFF.Membership|5,18 ORG-AFF.Employment
8,13 ORG-AFF.Membership|5,18 ORG-AFF.Employment

She admits , however , that , " The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping , " and that " After he became SG [ Secretary General ] , Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies . " Later , " Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly , " she writes .
15,17 ORG-AFF.Employment
15,17 ORG-AFF.Employment

But responsibility for what ?



The truth is that , as director of U.N. peacekeeping , Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide .
6,9 ORG-AFF.Employment|17,19 ORG-AFF.Employment|18,21 PHYS.Located
6,9 ORG-AFF.Employment|17,19 ORG-AFF.Employment|18,21 PHYS.Located

Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , Major General Romeo Dallaire , the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda , sent a fax to Kofi Annan 's office , saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned .

23,29 PER-SOC.Business|27,29 ORG-AFF.Employment|28,31 PHYS.Located|49,51 ORG-AFF.Employment

The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign .
5,7 ORG-AFF.Employment|10,12 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer
5,7 ORG-AFF.Employment|10,12 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer

All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family .



But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives .



He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now - infamous " genocide fax " from Annan 's office .



It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide !



The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place . Yup , good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide .



What a great guy he is is n't he .



Or how about the ongoing prostitution that 's going on in the Congo ?



Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal . Yeah ... this guy is such a good SG .



Eff him .



The article ends with the following :



In an April 30 , 2001 , Washington Times column , Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted " scant mention " to the " plain fact that it was Mr. Annan , when he was head of the United Nation 's peacekeeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994 .
37,45 ORG-AFF.Employment|40,45 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary|41,45 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary
37,45 ORG-AFF.Employment|40,45 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary

" It 's true , Hentoff said , that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged , to some extent , its role in the killings .



But for five and a half years , he noted , Annan " refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes .
32,34 ORG-AFF.Employment
32,34 ORG-AFF.Employment

" It is astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan 's role .
6,9 ORG-AFF.Employment

But that is what she was apparently paid to do .

2005 - 02 - 23T10:49:00 Got job ?



And so , I have rejoined the world of the fully employed .



After Christmas , I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses ( at my last full - time job ) .



She was looking for a Development Assistant at the retirement community where she works .
6,11 ORG-AFF.Employment
6,11 ORG-AFF.Employment

I started here 4 weeks ago .



WM is affiliated with , but not run or fully supported by , the denomination I 've been a part of all my life ( UMC ) .



My grandmother ( who was Baptist ) lived here for a few months before she died in 1995 , so I have many connections to the job .



Our offices are in one of the patio homes , and I have my own lovely office with a window .



The job 's only about 12 miles from home , and I 'm going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and afternoons .



It all seems perfect and yet ... Oh , I 'm so thankful to be somewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people 's lives , and I want to keep an open mind and hope it 'll last forever , but I have a feeling I 'll be restless within a year or so .



My boss is a very nice person , but conservative and resistant to technology , i.e. computers , internet , etc .



We just got new computers a week and half ago , and she 's griping about XP ( her old OS was Windows 98 - -mine was 95 , so I 'm thrilled with the new stuff ) .



I tell her it 'll just take some getting used to .



We 'll see .



I 'm not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get , but it 's the best salary I 've gotten thus far .



When I was fulltime in radio I made a little less , but I got quite a few remotes , which make up for not getting a topnotch salary .



I 'm still doing my TV announcing and my weekend radio stuff , so that money will help .



I 'm going to start actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so , too .



My plan is to pay off my car early , and then work on the other debts .



I think it 's time to go on and fill out the adoption applications .



I 'm terrified of more debt , but Mom and Dad will help with the money .



I 'm not sure they realize how expensive it all is .



I 'm thinking we might lean toward adopting from Guatemala , but we 've still not hashed it all out .



It 's almost bad making some money now , because while most of me wants to save as much as possible , the other , smaller part is screaming loudly for stuff , stuff , stuff ! ! !



I 've got a trial subscription to XM at work because of the Dell computers , and now I 'm lusting to have it all of the time .



G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an aux jack , so I could listen to it here .



He asked if I wanted a car stereo , and I said no , but I do .



There are so many things I want .



A garage .



A dining room set .



New stuff for our house .



New clothes .



New everything .



But I want family more .



I think part of the draw of the other stuff is I could get it now .



But I 'd be paying for it later .



Money makes the world go round and round and round til I 'm just dizzy .

Sotheby 's , Christie 's pay 40 million dollars over antitrust suits



NEW YORK , March 11 ( AFP )



The world 's most powerful fine art auction houses , Sotheby 's and Christie 's , have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an international price - fixing scam , Sotheby 's said .

1,9 GEN-AFF.Org-Location

The payment , if approved by the courts , would settle a slew of suits by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the United States , it said in a statement .



" Under the terms of the settlement agreement , Sotheby 's and Christie 's will each pay 20 million dollars , " said Sotheby 's , which operates in 34 countries .



The deal required threatened British and Canadian claims against both auction houses to be dropped .



Buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to pursue further cases in foreign courts .



The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States between January 1 , 1993 and February 7 , 2000 , and sellers between September 1 , 1995 and February 7 , 2000 .



Similar claims over US - based auctions were settled in an agreement struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars .



In December 2001 , a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby 's main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a price - fixing agreement with Christie 's .

Four months later , the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7.5-million - dollar fine over the price - fixing , which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars .



Christie 's was not prosecuted in the United States after its management agreed to testify against Sotheby 's and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent .



Together , Sotheby 's and Christie 's control more than 90 percent of the fine art and antiques market .



Sotheby 's said it would record the 20-million - dollar settlement as a special charge for 2002 .



It would be funded in two payments of 10 million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval .

Efforts were to continue at the United Nations Friday to find a breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on Iraq , with Washington warning it could bypass the Security Council and go to war alone .



With marathon talks at the top world body failing late Thursday to reconcile French and Russian opposition to US - British war plans , the United States upped its military presence , deploying more missile - firing warships to the Red Sea .

Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row



JAKARTA , March 27 ( AFP )



Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an Indian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Court for a second review , prosecutors said Thursday .

The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convicts .



The sixth offender has only made one appeal for a review .



President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and asked for a speedy execution .



Five of them are Indonesians convicted of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender , Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey .

" We are talking about someone 's life or death so we have to be very careful , " Azhar said .



A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower court .



Apart from those convicted of murder , 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners , four Indonesians and a Dutch citizen of Chinese - Indonesian origin .
