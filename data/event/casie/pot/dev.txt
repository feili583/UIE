Ticketfly has been grounded .



After a " series of recent issues , " the online ticketing service took down all its websites Thursday , saying it was " the target of a cyber incident . "



" Out of an abundance of caution , we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue , " the company said across its many properties .



Ticketfly did n't comment on whether any user information , such as credit card data , had been stolen in the cyberattack .

" We realize the gravity of this decision , but the security of client and customer data is our top priority , " a Ticketfly spokeswoman said in an email .



The company 's pages have been down since 6 a.m. ET .



A hacker who goes by " IShAkDz " has taken credit for the attack .



Before Ticketfly took down its websites , the hacker left a taunting message across the service 's website : " Your security down , I 'm not sorry .



Next time I will publish database .

The firm claims that such an attack could potentially “ decimate ” the entire cryptocurrency network .



Qihoo 360 went on to explain that bad actors would be able to attack the network by constructing and publishing smart contracts containing malicious code on the EOS mainnet and have EOS supernodes pack them into new blocks .



Subsequently the code would affect all nodes on the network , including those of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges , letting the attackers gain control of private keys to cryptocurrency transactions .



While EOS has not yet made any public comment on the issue , Qihoo 360 said in another blog update that the project ’s lead developer , Daniel Larimer , was notified of the issues and that he has since said the vulnerabilities – identified as issue number 3498 on Github – have been fixed .

40,44 patch-vulnerability
40,44 patch-vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused when repositories are cloned .



When cloning a repository , Git checks out the parent repository into the working directory as it prepares to clone the submodule .



Then , Git realizes that it does not need to perform the clone of submodule because the submodule ’s repository already exists on the disk from when it was checked in to the parent , and then was written to the working directory when the parent repository was checked out .



According to Microsoft , the problem lies in the fact that when Git repositories are cloned , there are important configuration details not obtained from the server , such as hooks , which are scripts that can be run at certain points in the Git workflow .



The configuration is not cloned from a remote server because that would lead to a vulnerability where remote servers could provide code that would be executed on the end user ’s computer .



Unfortunately , with the new vulnerability , that is exactly what happens , Microsoft explained .



Because the submodule ’s repository is checked in to a parent repository , it is not actually cloned .



Therefore , the submodule repository can already have a hook configured .



Additionally , if a user recursively cloned a malicious parent repository , it first checks out the parent , reads the submodule ’s checked - in repository and prepares to write that submodule to the working directory , then it executes post-checkout hooks , Microsoft explained .



In order to eliminate this vulnerability , submodule ’s folder names are examined more closely by Git clients .



Now , submodule folder names can no longer contain “ .



. ”



as a path segment and they can not be symbolic links .



As a result , they now will have to be within the .



git repository folder instead of in the actual repository ’s working directory .



According to Microsoft , Git now refuses to work with repositories that do not follow this newly specified configuration .



Visual Studio Team Services and other hosting providers will also reject users from pushing repositories that do not adhere to this submodule configuration to protect clients that have not been patched yet .

In 2018 thus far , the Russian security company blocked “ 3.7 million attempts to visit fraudulent social network pages ” .



Notably , 58.7 % of these attacks were attempting to direct users to fake FB pages .



That ’s a pretty substantial slice of the pie , considering that VKontakte — Russia ’s version of Facebook — was responsible for 20.8 % , and LinkedIn 12.9 % .



“ At the beginning of the year , Facebook was the most popular social networking brand for fraudsters to abuse , and Facebook pages were frequently faked by cybercriminals to try and steal personal data via phishing attacks , ” the company states in a press release .

The firm also suggests that this is nothing new .



“ Last year Facebook was one of the top three most exploited company names .



The schemes are numerous , but fairly standard : the user is asked to ‘ verify ’ an account or lured into signing into a phishing site on the promise of interesting content , ” it reveals .

SOUTH BEND — A local physicians network was the focus of a recent cyberattack that released ransomware into its network .



According to a news release from Allied Physicians of Michiana CEO Shery Roussarie , the company became aware of the cyberattack on Thursday afternoon and immediately took steps to shut down the network in order to protect personal and protected health information of patients .



The company restored its data in a secure format without significant disruption to patients , but an investigation is ongoing to confirm that personal or protected health information was n’t compromised .

TSB ’s banking meltdown , caused by a botched IT upgrade , still has not been remedied – nearly four weeks on .



And the crisis has become paydirt for scammers and hackers , who have waded into a confusing , chaotic situation and are making out with thousands of pounds worth of savings from people ’s accounts .



And it ’s not just TSB - the number of phishing texts claiming to be from other banks such as Barclays and NatWest also seems to be on the rise .

“ When a ‘ change ’ goes wrong and so publicly like TSB ’s , it ’s like cyber blood in the water , ” explains Ian Thornton - Trump , chief technical officer of Octopi Managed Services , an IT company .



“ Cyber criminals pay attention to companies rocked by internal scandals or public ‘ ball drops ’ and react accordingly . ”



With the bank ’s staff overloaded trying to fix the problems that caused the outage in the first place , fraudulent transactions are n’t being tracked or checked as quickly as they should be .



“ It is a sad fact that fraudsters might try to take advantage of situations like these , ” says a TSB spokesperson .



The scammers are using one of the most common tools in their arsenal : phishing attacks .

“ I think I was targeted whilst we could n’t actually view our money , ” says Evans .



“ Criminals are happy to exploit people ’s misery , whatever form that might take , ” says professor Alan Woodward , a cybersecurity specialist from the University of Surrey .



“ Criminals can pretend to be the bank and ask customers to undertake strange actions that under normal operations would seem suspicious .

Customers might be so delighted to actually be able to access their web banking that they might just let their guard down that little bit more than usual . ”



TSB has to act more proactively to shut down fraudulent domains and to make the public more aware of the scams circulating , Woodward argues .



“ TSB need to up their game in responding to customers – as that very lack of response can be used to lure customers in . ”



For those who have fallen victim , the loss of money is adding insult to injury .



“ I ’m certain I ’ll move banks , ” says Evans , who lost the contents of her current account .



“ Most of the staff have been helpful and apologetic , but this should have been resolved by now .



It seems they are not fit for purpose . ”



Phishing takes place when a fraudster tricks an individual into sharing sensitive information ( account numbers , Social Security numbers , login credentials , etc. ) by way of fraudulent emails , texts , or counterfeit websites .

Gmail ’s new Confidential Mode may invite link - baiting phishing attacks .
7,12 phishing
7,12 phishing

According to analysis by ComputerWorld , “ Confidential Mode works by storing your email in a secure space on Google servers in the cloud .



When both sender and recipient use Gmail , the email appears normal .



But recipients who do not use Gmail get a link for viewing the email in a browser .



The messages you send or receive via Confidential Mode are not actually email .



The link is an email , but the message is an email - looking page on the internet that ’s password - protected .



Emails containing the link can , in fact , be forwarded , but only the intended recipient can successfully open the link .



When someone gets one of these forwarded mails , they ’re prompted for their Google login username and password to determine whether or not they ’re the intended recipient .



This is problematic , because it invites link - baiting phishing attacks , which could con people into revealing their login information . ”

When Cloquet school officials realized staff were unable to access certain files the morning of Aug 3 , there may have been a certain amount of negative " been there , done that " feeling involved .



For the second time in three years , the school district is the target of a ransomware attack — a particularly virulent computer malware that spreads from computer to computer , locking up access to network servers and turning documents into gibberish before offering " help " in the form of a request for payment to provide a " key " to unlock the files .

Last time , in March 2016 , the district had to cancel school for a day to allow technology staff time to recover from the malware , which infected some of the district 's servers and many of its more than 600 computers .



This time , it happened over summer vacation , and the attack was not as devastating .



According to the staff report from Cloquet School District Technology Director T.J.Smith , the virus encrypted files on all servers except one , including network shared drives .



However , there is no indication that any information was " stolen , " just that it had been encrypted , so users were unable to open the files .

8,9 data|9,12 databreach|8,12 r_compromised-data

Smith explained to Cloquet School Board members Monday , Aug 13 , that the district had two options , not including paying the ransom demand : either try to recover the data , which may not be successful and could be a waste of time and money , or figure out how to recreate the data and rebuild the affected servers .

13,15 organization|7,11 time|21,25 ransom|13,25 r_victim|7,25 r_time

He advocated the second option , noting that the lost data was not " mission critical " and that insurance will pay to return the servers to their previous state .



Board members voted unanimously for the second option of re-creating information and rebuilding the servers ; they also voted to hire a company to do a " forensic " investigation to try and determine how the virus got in .



The total cost to the school district for insurance deductibles , estimated at $ 15,000 , will be covered by money already in the technology budget .



Superintendent Michael Cary said the district determined that paying a ransom " is not in the best interest of our schools and the community we serve . "

Board Chairman Ted Lammi said he believes such payments to hackers should be illegal .



" Some institutions have paid big bucks and that 's why these guys do it , " Lammi said .



Board member Duane Buytaert , who works in technology for Carlton County , said it can also be a matter of making sure users know how to detect such attacks .



" We all get those wacky emails , " he said .



Staff training should be a priority , board members agreed .



On the positive side , Smith said technology staff were able to recover quite a bit of data already , and staff can recreate the data that was lost .



The recovery process should not affect the start of school Sept 5 .

Do n’t panic !



But you should stop using PGP for encrypted email and switch to a different secure communications method for now .



A group of researchers released a paper today that describes a new class of serious vulnerabilities in PGP ( including GPG ) , the most popular email encryption standard .
14,16 vulnerability|17,18 software|20,21 software|0,4 person|9,10 discover-vulnerability|9,15 vulnerability|9,16 vulnerability|9,18 vulnerable-system|9,21 vulnerable-system|0,10 r_discoverer|1,10 r_discoverer|2,10 r_discoverer|3,10 r_discoverer

The new paper includes a proof - of - concept exploit that can allow an attacker to use the victim ’s own email client to decrypt previously acquired messages and return the decrypted content to the attacker without alerting the victim .



The proof of concept is only one implementation of this new type of attack , and variants may follow in the coming days .



Because of the straightforward nature of the proof of concept , the severity of these security vulnerabilities , the range of email clients and plugins affected , and the high level of protection that PGP users need and expect , EFF is advising PGP users to pause in their use of the tool and seek other modes of secure end - to - end communication for now .



Because we are awaiting the response from the security community of the flaws highlighted in the paper , we recommend that for now you uninstall or disable your PGP email plug - in .



These steps are intended as a temporary , conservative stopgap until the immediate risk of the exploit has passed and been mitigated against by the wider community .



There may be simpler mitigations available soon , as vendors and commentators develop narrower solutions , but this is the safest stance to take for now .
4,5 patch|5,6 patch-vulnerability|4,6 r_patch
4,5 patch|5,6 patch-vulnerability|4,6 r_patch

Because sending PGP - encrypted emails to an unpatched client will create adverse ecosystem incentives to open incoming emails , any of which could be maliciously crafted to expose ciphertext to attackers .



While you may not be directly affected , the other participants in your encrypted conversations are likely to be .



For this attack , it is n’t important whether the sender or the receiver of the original secret message is targeted .



This is because a PGP message is encrypted to both of their keys .



At EFF , we have relied on PGP extensively both internally and to secure much of our external - facing email communications .



Because of the severity of the vulnerabilities disclosed today , we are temporarily dialing down our use of PGP for both internal and external email .



Our recommendations may change as new information becomes available , and we will update this post when that happens .



This week , Adobe released its monthly scheduled update bundle addressing vulnerabilities within its different products .

“ The Manager listens on port 7809 where it accepts GoldenGate Software Command Interface ( GGSCI ) commands .



Tenable found that a remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger a stack buffer overflow by sending a GGSCI command that is longer than expected . ”



The attack is not complex and a bad actor could be remote and unauthenticated .



Making matters worse , an attacker could compromise other products after initially attacking GoldenGate , the advisory warned .



“ While the vulnerability is in Oracle GoldenGate , attacks may significantly impact additional products , ” the note said .

0,3 vulnerability|11,13 organization|17,20 discover-vulnerability|0,20 r_vulnerability|11,20 r_discoverer

So basically , you ’d need to open the Windows client , open Configuration , User Profile , and click on ‘ Show Password ’ .



A spokesperson for PureVPN sent us the following statement .



" This is not a vulnerability rather a feature that we deployed for ease of our users .



Back in April 2018 , when Trustwave reported it to us , we assessed the risk , and found it minimally due to how our systems are designed .



Our systems work a bit different than most of the other VPN providers .



For enhanced security , we use separate passwords for Member Area and VPN access .



Member Area password which is more privileged is not shown in apps , it 's the VPN access password that is the subject of this feature .



Furthermore , by default , our VPN passwords are system generated and not set by users .



This curtails the risk of users using the same password for VPN accounts that they use for their sensitive accounts elsewhere on the Internet .



On the other hand , this enhanced security design proved a little difficult for quite a few of our users and hence we offered a way for them to easily retrieve their VPN password .



For now the community has raised concerns and is confusing it as a vulnerability , we have temporarily removed the feature and released a newer version 6.2.2 .
2,4 organization|15,16 organization|23,27 version|1,2 time|22,23 patch-vulnerability|2,23 r_releaser|3,23 r_releaser|15,23 r_releaser|22,24 patch-number|22,25 patch-number|22,26 patch-number|22,27 patch-number|1,23 r_time

To those users of our who pretty much use this feature to retrieve the separate password for VPN we would like to inform that we plan to redesign the future , keeping these concerns in mind , and release it back in our November 2018 release .



We use Bugcrowd , a public Bug Bounty Program that employees some 90,000 ethical hackers to test our product .



We remain in heavy collaboration with the InfoSec community and hence have such aggressive and streamlined processes in place to have released the new version 6.2.2 within a few hours only .

The vulnerabilities are in in the Telematics Control Unit ( TCU ) , the Central Gateway Module , and Head Unit , across a range of interfaces including via GSM , BMW Remote Service , BMW ConnectedDrive , Remote Diagnosis , NGTP , Bluetooth , and the USB / OBD - II interfaces .
0,2 vulnerability|5,12 device|13,17 device|19,21 device
0,2 vulnerability|5,12 device|13,17 device|19,21 device

Some require local access ( e.g. via USB ) to exploit but six including the Bluetooth flaw were accessible remotely , making them the most serious .



Should owners worry that the flaws could be exploited , endangering drivers and vehicles ?

On the basis of the technical description , that seems unlikely , although Keen Lab wo n’t release the full proof - of - concept code until 2019 .



Keen Lab described the effect of its hacking as allowing it to carry out : The execution of arbitrary , unauthorized diagnostic requests of BMW in - car systems remotely .



To which BMW responded : BMW Group has already implemented security measures , which are currently being rolled out via over-the-air configuration updates .



Additional security enhancements for the affected infotainment systems are being developed and will be available as software updates for customers .

To BMW , judging by the triumphant language of its press release , it ’s as if this was the plan all along , right down to awarding Keen Lab the “ first - ever BMW Group Digitalization and IT Research Award . ”



More likely , car makers are being caught out by the attention their in - car systems are getting from researchers , with Volkswagen Audi Group experiencing some of the same discomfort a couple of weeks ago at the hands of Dutch researchers .



BMW has experienced this before too – three years ago it suffered an embarrassing security flaw in its car ConnectedDrive software door - locking systems .

In a web - based attack , specially designed web pages could exploit the same vulnerability when using Internet Explorer .



Embedding AcitveX controls that were marked " safe for initialization " inside of a Microsoft Office document also allowed for unsafe code to be executed since the IE rendering engine is used .



One of the more interesting parts of the attack is that it does not matter what a user 's default browser is .



When using VBScript , it is possible to force a web page to be loaded using Internet Explorer even if Chrome , FireFox , Safari , Opera or another browser is set to default .



This particular vulnerability has been found in use and affects Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 and newer .

Kasperksy Lab has provided a fairly detailed analysis of how the exploit functions .



In short , a statement from their security researchers says it all .



" We expect this vulnerability to become one of the most exploited in the near future , as it wo n’t be long until exploit kit authors start abusing it in both drive - by ( via browser ) and spear - phishing ( via document ) campaigns . "

While the phishing messages might look legitimate at first glance , it 's worth noting they do n't use the right domain - the fake messages come from ' @mail .

A remote attacker could execute malware on a Windows host using a malicious Docker container image if they managed to trick an authenticated administrator to import it in Docker for Windows , which uses the hcsshim library .



" An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system , " Microsoft notes in its advisory .

Hcsshim , which is written in Go , is an open - source wrapper that Microsoft developed for use with its Host Compute Service , a container management API in Windows Hyper - V virtualization for Docker .



The HCS abstraction layer is Microsoft 's way of allowing Docker containers to use Linux kernel features on Windows , such as Linux Namespaces and Control Groups .



Hanselmann explains that the flaw stems from hccshim 's use of a function from Go and the failure to sanitize input from an imported container image .



" Its use of Go 's filepath.Join function with unsanitized input [ made it possible ] to create , remove and replace files in the host file system , leading to remote code execution , " he noted .



" Importing a Docker container image or pulling one from a remote registry is n't commonly expected to make modifications to the host file system outside the Docker - internal data structures . "



Separately , Microsoft is reportedly working on a fix for a " fatal flaw " in its initial Windows 10 fix for the Meltdown CPU vulnerability .

Remember when the sky -- or at least Ryzen -- was falling ?



You should , because it was only a few months ago , when the CTS Labs security company revealed numerous vulnerabilities in AMD 's new Ryzen and EPYC processor lines .

AMD has been largely quiet about these vulnerabilities in the time since , but the company assured Tom 's Hardware that it has n't forgotten about CTS Labs ' report or neglected to address the flaws in its processors .

A quick recap : In March , CTS Labs released information on a collection of vulnerabilities in AMD 's latest chips that it dubbed " Ryzenfall . "

The company said it believed many of the vulnerabilities would take months to fix , with the Chimera issues requiring a hardware change that could n't be implemented in products that have already shipped .
7,9 vulnerability|13,14 patch-vulnerability|7,14 r_vulnerability|8,14 r_vulnerability

Because the exploit requires the local execution of code , it does n’t necessarily warrant an out - of - band update .



However , with proof of concept code readily available , it ’s possible nefarious individuals could trick less savvy users into running the code and gain full access to their systems .



As always , never execute any files from unknown or untrusted sources.The bug lies in the Windows Task Scheduler ’s Advanced Local Procedure Call , or ALPC , interface .



It allows a local user to gain system level privileges and have free reign over the system to do whatever they want , including overwriting / modifying system files .



Will Dormann of CERT / CC verified the original exploit code works on a fully patched Windows 10 x64 installation and later modified the code to work on 32 - bit systems as well .

For those running 7.x , that means upgrading to Drupal 7.59 .



For those running , 8.5.x , the latest version if 8.5.3 .



And for those still on 8.4.x , there 's an upgrade to 8.4.8 , despite the fact that as an unsupported minor release , the 8.4.x line would not normally get security updates .

Phishing is one of the most devious scams for filching your personal information , but experts say it is possible to avoid them if you know what you 're looking for .
9,13 purpose|0,1 phishing|0,10 purpose|0,11 purpose|0,12 purpose|0,13 purpose
9,13 purpose|0,1 phishing|0,13 purpose

At its essence , phishing is the act of pretending to be someone or something you trust in order to trick you into entering sensitive data like your user name and password .

The goal -- of course -- is to take your money .



Some of the most common phishing scams are bogus emails purportedly from trustworthy institutions like the U.S.Internal Revenue Service or major banks .

The devices were originally manufactured by St Jude Medical , which Abbott acquired last year .



At that time , St Jude was under fire for remaining quiet about defibrillator issues that caused rapid battery depletion .



The FDA found St Jude continued to ship these devices despite knowing about the defect .



In fact , the agency found those flaws caused patient deaths .



The flaws , made public in 2016 by Muddy Waters and security firm MedSec , could allow an unauthorized user to access the defibrillaors and modify the programming controls .

The FDA ’s recall notice said the firmware update will reduce the risk of patient harm due to premature battery depletion and potential exploitation of the flaws in the devices .



The update will effectively complete the necessary patches to prevent unauthorized access .



The update is not a response to any new flaws , but are merely a continuation of last year ’s patches , according to officials .



" Technology and its security are always evolving , and this firmware upgrade is part of our commitment to ensuring our products include the latest advancements and protections for patients , " said Robert Ford , executive vice president of medical devices at Abbott , in a statement .

The Next Web did not reveal the site ’s address in its report , citing security reasons , but noted that it does n’t appear that any user had made payment .



This is the latest ransomware in recent months that demand cryptocurrency as a form of payment .

Microsoft has published a patch for an Outlook vulnerability first reported in late 2016 , but the patch has been deemed incomplete and additional workarounds are needed , according to the security researcher who discovered it .

Yesterday 's April 2018 Patch Tuesday updates train included a fix for CVE -2018-0950 , a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook discovered by Will Dormann , a vulnerability analyst at the CERT Coordination Center ( CERT / CC ) .

Outlook retrieves remote OLE content without prompting According to Dormann , the main problem with CVE -2018-0950 is that Microsoft Outlook will automatically render the content of remote OLE objects embedded inside rich formatted emails without prompting the user , something that Microsoft does in other Office apps such as Word , Excel , and PowerPoint .



This leads to a slew of problems that come from automatically rendering OLE objects , a common attack vector for malware authors .



Microsoft patches SMB attack vector only In a CERT / CC vulnerability note , Dormann says he notified Microsoft of Outlook 's propensity for loading OLE objects without alerting users in November 2016 .



After almost 18 months , the company finally issued a patch for the reported issue , but Dormann says the patch does not address the problem at the core of the issue .

Dormann points out that Outlook still does not prompt user for permission to render OLE objects for email previews .



Furthermore , the researcher also highlights that there are other ways of obtaining the NTLM hashes , such as embedding UNC links to SMB servers inside the email , links that Outlook will automatically make clickable .



" If a user clicks such a link , the impact will be the same as with this vulnerability , " Dormann says .



But even this incomplete patch is good news .



This means that while Outlook will continue to render OLE objects inside email previews , at least these objects ca n't be used to steal NTLM hashes via SMB anymore .



To avoid attackers from getting their hands on NTLM hashes via SMB altogether , the expert recommends that system administrators apply additional OS - level workarounds ,



The city has spent the past two weeks restoring online services disrupted by ransomware that held encrypted data hostage .

Soon after Atlanta City Auditor Amanda Noble logged onto her work computer the morning of March 22 , she knew something was wrong .



The icons on her desktop looked different — in some cases replaced with black rectangles — and she noticed many of the files on her desktop had been renamed with “ weapologize ” or “ imsorry ” extensions .



Noble called the city ’s chief information security officer to report the problem and left a message .



Next , she called the help desk and was put on hold for a while .



“ At that point , I realized that I was n’t the only one in the office with computer problems , ” Noble says .



Those computer problems were part of a high - profile “ ransomware ” cyberattack on the City of Atlanta that has lasted nearly two weeks and has yet to be fully resolved .

During that time the metropolis has struggled to recover encrypted data on employees ’ computers and restore services on the municipal Web site .



The criminals initially gave the city seven days to pay about $ 51,000 in the cryptocurrency bitcoin to get the decryption key for their data .

City officials would not comment on the matter when contacted by Scientific American .



The Department of Watershed Management , for example , still can not accept online or telephone payments for water and sewage bills , nor can the Department of Finance issue business licenses through its Web page .



The Atlanta Municipal Court has been unable to process ticket payments either online or in person due to the outage and has had to reschedule some of its hearings .



The city took down two of its online services voluntarily as a security precaution : the Hartsfield – Jackson Atlanta International Airport wi - fi network and the ability to process service requests via the city ’s 311 Web site portal , according to Anne Torres , Atlanta ’s director of communications .



Both are now back online , with airport wi - fi restored Tuesday morning .



The ransomware used to attack Atlanta is called SamSam .



Like most malicious software it typically enters computer networks through software whose security protections have not been updated .



When attackers find vulnerabilities in a network , they use the ransomware to encrypt files there and demand payment to unlock them .

The city ’s technology department — Atlanta Information Management ( AIM ) — contacted local law enforcement , along with the FBI , Department of Homeland Security , Secret Service and independent forensic experts to help assess the damage and investigate the attack .



The attackers set up an online payment portal for the city but soon took the site offline after a local television station published a screen shot of the ransom note , which included a link to the bitcoin wallet meant to collect the ransom .

“ Ransomware gangs typically cut off communications once their victims get law enforcement involved , ” he says .



“ Atlanta made it clear at a press conference soon after the malware was detected ” that they had done so .



The length of time it has taken to slowly bring services back online also suggests the cyber criminals abandoned Atlanta without decrypting the city ’s files , Williams says .



“ If that ’s the case , the city ’s IT staff spent the past week rebuilding Atlanta ’s online systems using backed - up data that had not been hit by the ransomware , ” he says , adding that any data not backed up is likely “ lost for good . ”

Six weeks after ransomware forced Colorado Department of Transportation ’s back - end operations offline , the agency is back to 80 percent functionality — at an estimated cost of up to $ 1.5 million , according to the state .



Colorado officials said they never caved to the attacker ’s demands to pay bitcoin in order to recover encrypted computer files .

But clearing each computer took time and additional resources — including the Colorado National Guard — to investigate , contain and recover .



“ We were able to recover from the SamSam attack relatively quickly due to our robust backup plan and our segmentation strategies , ” Brandi Simmons , a spokesperson for Colorado ’s Office of Information Technology , said in an email .



“ We are still capturing costs associated with the incident , but our estimate is between $ 1M and $ 1.5 M. ” What started with a core team of 25 IT employees , Simmons said , ballooned to 150 “ during the peak of the incident ” — March 2 - 9 .



She added that others included CDOT , the FBI , state emergency operations and private companies .



The million - dollar estimate includes only overtime pay and other unexpected costs .



The state ’s new backup system prevented data loss , but personal data on employees ’ computers may not be recovered .



The cyberattack started around Feb 21 when a variant of the SamSam ransomware hijacked CDOT computer files .



CDOT shut down more than 2,000 computers .



Its employees had to use personal devices to check email .



The state did not share the value of bitcoin that attackers demanded .

Elsewhere , SamSam attacked the city of Atlanta , debilitating computer systems that residents used to pay traffic tickets , report potholes and access Wi - Fi at the airport .



The city has n’t issued a public update since March 30 , and a city spokesman said Thursday there is nothing new to share .



Attackers demanded $ 51,000 worth of bitcoin .

Dan Likarish , a computer professor at Denver ’s Regis University , said there ’s still a good reason not to do it .



“ If you pay the ransom , you ’re supporting the criminal , ” said Likarish , adding there ’s also no guarantee the attacker will return computer files intact .

“ The weasel answer ?



It ’s a risk mitigation .



That ’s the way we label ourselves .



We talk to upper management , present the business case that we ’ve identified the problem , let ’s just pay .



That ’s what a lot of hospitals have done .



It ’s not unusual to pay for the key and go about your business .



It depends on how sophisticated your security staff is .



If you do n’t have it , what do you do ?



You ’ve got to keep things running . ”



Likarish said he was able to help with efforts to contain the CDOT attack and was in awe at how the state ’s IT office swooped in and took command .



While IT staff had already updated its own computer operations , not every state agency is on the same system , including CDOT .



“ People are listening to them now , ” Likarish said .



IBM ’s latest X-Force Threat Intelligence Index report reveals that more than 2.9 billion records were leaked through publicly disclosed incidents in 2017 .

Why ?



Because hackers are shifting over to ransomware .



They ’re becoming more focused on holding files hostage for money than on unleashing all that data to the dark markets .



According to IBM , this shift to ransomware cost corporations more than $ 8 billion globally during 2017 , a number derived from downtime , ransom payments , and other impacts on day - to - day business .

Ransomware is a type of malware that infiltrates a network and encrypts files on connected PCs .



These files become unrecoverable , and require a “ key ” generated by the hacker to be released from captivity .



These keys are provided after a payment using cryptocurrency , adding to the overall cost corporations incur due to downtime .



Hiring a third party to recover the files may or may not work , depending on the level of encryption .



“ With the potentially irreversible encryption lock of crypto - ransomware , victims without up - to - date backups often choose to pay the ransom their attackers demand , ” the report states .

Intel has issued fresh " microcode revision guidance " that reveals it wo n’t address the Meltdown and Spectre design flaws in all of its vulnerable processors – in some cases because it 's too tricky to remove the Spectre v2 class of vulnerabilities .
0,1 organization|11,12 organization|15,17 vulnerability|18,21 vulnerability|24,27 device|38,44 vulnerability|1,3 patch-vulnerability|14,15 patch-vulnerability|0,2 r_releaser|0,3 r_releaser|11,15 r_releaser|14,16 vulnerability|14,17 vulnerability|14,19 vulnerability|14,20 vulnerability|14,21 vulnerability|14,25 vulnerable-system|14,26 vulnerable-system|14,27 vulnerable-system|14,39 vulnerability|14,40 vulnerability|14,41 vulnerability|14,42 vulnerability|14,43 vulnerability|14,44 vulnerability

The new guidance , issued April 2 , adds a “ stopped ” status to Intel ’s “ production status ” category in its array of available Meltdown and Spectre security updates .



" Stopped " indicates there will be no microcode patch to kill off Meltdown and Spectre .
7,10 patch|13,14 vulnerability|15,16 vulnerability|11,13 patch-vulnerability|7,12 r_patch|7,13 r_patch|8,12 r_patch|8,13 r_patch|9,12 r_patch|9,13 r_patch|11,14 vulnerability|12,14 vulnerability|11,16 vulnerability|12,16 vulnerability
7,10 patch|13,14 vulnerability|15,16 vulnerability|11,13 patch-vulnerability|7,13 r_patch|11,14 vulnerability|11,16 vulnerability

The guidance explains that a chipset earns “ stopped ” status because , “ after a comprehensive investigation of the microarchitectures and microcode capabilities for these products , Intel has determined to not release microcode updates for these products for one or more reasons . ”
34,36 patch|25,27 device|28,29 organization|33,34 patch-vulnerability|33,35 patch|33,36 patch|25,34 r_vulnerable-system|26,34 r_vulnerable-system|28,34 r_releaser
34,36 patch|25,27 device|28,29 organization|33,34 patch-vulnerability|33,36 patch|25,34 r_vulnerable-system|28,34 r_releaser

Those reasons are given as : Micro-architectural characteristics that preclude a practical implementation of features mitigating [ Spectre ] Variant 2 ( CVE -2017-5715 ) Limited Commercially Available System Software support Based on customer inputs , most of these products are implemented as “ closed systems ” and therefore are expected to have a lower likelihood of exposure to these vulnerabilities .
16,21 vulnerability|22,24 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|15,16 patch-vulnerability|15,17 vulnerability|15,18 vulnerability|15,19 vulnerability|15,20 vulnerability|15,21 vulnerability|15,23 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|15,24 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures
16,21 vulnerability|22,24 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|15,16 patch-vulnerability|15,21 vulnerability|15,24 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures

Thus , if a chip family falls under one of those categories – such as Intel ca n't easily fix Spectre v2 in the design , or customers do n't think the hardware will be exploited – it gets a " stopped " sticker .
20,22 vulnerability|15,16 organization|32,33 device|19,20 patch-vulnerability|34,36 discover-vulnerability|19,21 vulnerability|19,22 vulnerability|15,20 r_releaser|32,35 r_vulnerable-system|32,36 r_vulnerable-system

To leverage the vulnerabilities , malware needs to be running on a system , so if the computer is totally closed off from the outside world , administrators may feel it 's not worth the hassle applying messy microcode , operating system , or application updates .



" Stopped " CPUs that wo n’t therefore get a fix are in the Bloomfield , Bloomfield Xeon , Clarksfield , Gulftown , Harpertown Xeon C0 and E0 , Jasper Forest , Penryn / QC , SoFIA 3GR , Wolfdale , Wolfdale Xeon , Yorkfield , and Yorkfield Xeon families .

The new list includes various Xeons , Core CPUs , Pentiums , Celerons , and Atoms – just about everything Intel makes .



Most the CPUs listed above are oldies that went on sale between 2007 and 2011 , so it is likely few remain in normal use .



There ’s some good news in the tweaked guidance : the Arrandale , Clarkdale , Lynnfield , Nehalem , and Westmere families that were previously un-patched now have working fixes available in production , apparently .

Now all Intel has to do is sort out a bunch of lawsuits , make sure future products do n’t have similar problems , combat a revved - up - and - righteous AMD and Qualcomm in the data centre , find a way to get PC buyers interested in new kit again , and make sure it does n’t flub emerging markets like IoT and 5G like it flubbed the billion - a-year mobile CPU market .



Intel revealed that it will not be issuing Spectre patches to a number of older Intel processor families , potentially leaving many customers vulnerable to the security exploit .

Intel claims the processors affected are mostly implemented as closed systems , so they are n’t at risk from the Spectre exploit , and that the age of these processors means they have limited commercial availability .



The processors which Intel wo n’t be patching include four lines from 2007 , Penryn , Yorkfield , and Wolfdale , along with Bloomfield ( 2009 ) , Clarksfield ( 2009 ) , Jasper Forest ( 2010 ) and the Intel Atom SoFIA processors from 2015 .

It sounds bad , but as Intel pointed out , these are all relatively old processors — with the exception of the Intel Atom SoFIA processor , which came out in 2015 — and it ’s unlikely they ’re used in any high - security environments .



The Spectre exploit is a serious security vulnerability to be sure , but as some commentators have pointed out in recent months , it ’s not the kind of exploit the average user needs to worry about .

Threat researchers from Dell - owned Secureworks , which is based in Atlanta , have been working to help the city recover from the attack .



The security firm identified the assailants as the SamSam hacking group , The New York Times reported on Thursday .



That organization has been known for similar ransomware attacks ; it typically makes ransom demands of $ 50,000 or more , usually payable only with bitcoin .

In addition , a number of independent experts , including researchers from Georgia Tech , have been called in to determine how the attack occurred and help strategize to prevent another such attack .



As of Thursday , the city 's Department of Information Management , which first discovered the attack on March 21 , said that it had found no evidence that customer or employee data was compromised .

" Because in a securely configured network , Smart Install technology participants should not be accessible through the internet .



But scanning the internet has shown that this is not true , " wrote Embedi . "



During a short scan of the internet , we detected 250,000 vulnerable devices and 8.5 million devices that have a vulnerable port open .



" Smart Install is supported by a broad range of Cisco routers and switches .



The high number of devices with an open port is probably because the Smart Install client 's port TCP 4786 is open by default .



This situation is overlooked by network admins , Embedi said .



The company has also published proof - of - concept exploit code , so it probably will be urgent for admins to patch .

To recap , Meltdown ( aka F ** CKWIT or CVE -2017-5754 ) is a proof - of - concept hardware vulnerability uncovered almost simultaneously by several groups of researchers through which an attacker could access the contents of kernel memory ( passwords , encryption keys , say ) from the part used by ordinary applications .

But according to Ulf Frisk , something went awry starting with the January update when applied to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 , which miss - set controlling permissions for something called the Page Map Level 4 ( PML4 ) .



This is a table used by Intel microprocessors to “ translate the virtual addresses of a process into physical memory addresses in RAM . ”



Set correctly , only the kernel should be able to access this table .



The result of the issue is that an attacker aware of the flaw would have the ability to break out of the application space and take over a system .



All this from a simple software mistake : No fancy exploits were needed .



Windows 7 already did the hard work of mapping in the required memory into every running process .



Exploitation was just a matter of read and write to already mapped in - process virtual memory .



No fancy APIs or syscalls required – just standard read and write !



Microsoft today issued an emergency security update to correct a security update it issued earlier this month to correct a security update it issued in January and February .

" We are dealing with a hostage situation , " Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement .



On Thursday , municipal courts were closed again and residents were unable to pay their traffic tickets or water bills online .



In some cases , employees had to fill out urgent forms and reports by hand , CNN reported .



The city allowed its employees to turn on their work computers and printers for the first time on Wednesday , although officials warned that some computers may still be affected .



In a ransomware attack , hackers place malware on a computer — or system of computers — that restricts access , and then demand payment to undo it .

Bottoms would not say whether the city would meet their request .



Atlanta officials — along with local law enforcement , the FBI , the Department of Homeland Security , and Secret Service — are said to be working round - the - clock on the matter to investigate whether any government data or anybody 's personal information was compromised .

An information portal has been set up on the city government 's website to keep residents and employees updated on the latest developments of the hack .



Officials from Atlanta Information Management , the city 's technology department , realized the city had been attacked on March 22 .



As a result , officials said , " some city data is encrypted and customers are not able to access city applications . "



This has mostly prevented people from using online applications to pay bills and access court - related information .



Although Atlanta officials have not yet identified those behind the attack , an Atlanta - based security firm called Dell SecureWorks , which is helping the city investigate the attack , pointed to a group called SamSam , according to The New York Times .



It is not clear who is part of the group or where it is based .



On Monday , Mayor Bottoms held a news conference to reassure the public that the city was doing everything in its power to restore its systems , but cautioned people against taking the matter lightly .



" I just want to make the point that this is much bigger than a ransomware attack , " Bottoms said .

Dave Fitz , an FBI spokesman , could not be reached Wednesday .



On Tuesday , Fitz said the agency was aware of the breach and providing assistance to the city , but otherwise declined to comment .



The attack infiltrated a server that runs the city ’s computer - aided dispatch , or CAD , system for 911 and 311 calls .



The system automatically populates 911 callers ’ locations on maps and dispatches the closest emergency responders there more seamlessly than is possible with manual dispatching .



It also relays information to first responders in some cases and logs information for data retention and records .



The breach shut down the CAD system from Sunday morning until Monday morning , forcing the city to revert to manual dispatching during that time .



While the city ’s 911 calls are normally recorded online on Open Baltimore , the city dispatch logs stopped recording them at 9:54 a.m. Sunday and did n’t resume recording them again until 7:42 a.m. Monday .



Johnson said the attack was made possible after a city information technology team troubleshooting a separate communications issue with the server inadvertently changed a firewall and left a port , or a channel to the Internet , open for about 24 hours , and hackers who were likely running automated scans of networks looking for such vulnerabilities found it and gained access .

Johnson said his office works diligently to prevent cyberattacks and is looking to invest more in safeguarding its networks .



Baltimore also faced cyberattacks during the unrest in 2015 , when its website was taken offline .



Johnson said he was unaware of any other successful attacks on the city ’s networks .



He said the city would be obligated to disclose any attacks that compromised residents ’ personal information , health information or crime data .

Johnson said he feels the city recovered well from the breach once it was identified , but that he did not want to go into detail about what was done lest he expose the city to more attacks .



The city has a $ 2.5 million contract with TriTech Software Systems to maintain its CAD software and provide “ technical support services to ensure the functional integrity ” of the city ’s CAD system .



Scott MacDonald , TriTech ’s vice president of public safety strategy , said the company worked with city IT personnel to shut down the CAD software after the attack .



The breach was not related to the company ’s software , MacDonald said .



“ Our techs connected and worked with the IT staff there , and the CAD system was taken down manually , in combination between our staff and theirs , while the servers could be troubleshooted by the city . ”



Ransomware is costing UK companies a whopping £ 346 million every year , despite Britain being labelled ‘ the most resolute ’ country for dealing with the cyber attacks .

Results show that the overall percentage of companies experiencing ransomware has increased from 48 per cent in 2016 to 56 per cent in 2018 , however the average number per year has fallen from six to five attacks .



The amount of time spent decrypting ransomware attacks has also increased from 33 to 40 man - hours .

The study also reveals that employees are considered the major culprits responsible for introducing the malware into the business .



This was further supported by the fact that phishing , which seeks to socially engineer employees , was the top attack vector by which ransomware infiltrated the business in 69 per cent of instances .

Migo Kedem , director of Product Management at SentinelOne said : “ It ’s staggering to see the cost to British businesses of £ 346 million .



This figure shows that businesses are becoming increasingly aware that it ’s not just the ransom demand , but rather the ancillary costs of downtime , staff time , lost business , as well as the data recovery costs and reputational damage that are the biggest concern to British businesses . ”

He added : “ On a more positive note , it ’s good to see CISOs feeling more bullish about their ability to tackle ransomware using the latest behavioural AI - based end - point technology .



It ’s also encouraging to see a clear movement against companies caving in to ransomware demands , preferring instead to take more proactive measure such as back - ups and patching of vulnerable systems .

However , the volume of ransomware attacks is still increasing and their speed , scale , sophistication and success in evading detection with the growth in file-less and memory - based malware , explains why ransomware will continue to be a major threat to CISOs in 2018 and beyond . ”

On Friday , March 23 , city employees were handed a printed notice as they walked through the front doors .



They were told not to turn on their computers until the issue was resolved .



Officials were still unsure who was behind the attack .



Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms advised city employees and customers to monitor their personal information , although there was no evidence to show customer or employee data was compromised .

Atlanta is currently working with the Department of Homeland Security , the FBI , Microsoft , and Cisco cybersecurity officials to determine the scope of the damage and regain control of the data held hostage .



“ Our Atlanta Information Management team is working diligently with support from Microsoft to resolve the issue , ” the city ’s official Twitter account states .



“ We are confident that our team of technology professionals will be able to restore applications soon .



Our city website , Atlantaga.gov , remains accessible and we will provide updates as we receive them . ”



As of Thursday afternoon , the city said it faced outages on various “ internal and customer facing applications , ” such as means for accessing court - related information and paying bills .



But the city itself is n’t exactly under siege : Airport , public safety , and water operations remain unaffected by the attack , and the city payroll was n’t touched .



The only bone Atlanta is throwing the public is that the attack affects “ various city systems . ”



According to Atlanta ’s newly appointed chief operating officer , Richard Cox , Atlanta Information Management officials were made aware of problems with internal and customer - facing applications at 5:40 a.m. Thursday .



At the time , he acknowledged that the city fell prey to ransomware , but given the investigation is still ongoing , he could n’t provide the extent of the damage .



“ The ongoing investigation will determine whether personal information , financial , or employee data has been compromised , ” he said during a press briefing .

What the city did n’t officially disclose was the ransomware note discovered in the investigation .



A screenshot reveals the hackers ’ demands : 0.8 Bitcoins for each seized computer , or six bitcoins to unlock all computers held hostage , equaling to around $ 51,000 in real cash .

The hackers will then provide decryption software to release the computers from captivity .



The SamSam malware does n’t take the typical route of installing itself on computers when unsuspecting owners click a link within an email .



Instead , hackers find unpatched vulnerabilities in network servers and manually unleash SamSam to seize key data systems and cause maximum damage to the company ’s infrastructure .

SamSam is one of many in a family of ransomware targeting government and healthcare organizations .



It was first observed in 2015 and encrypts various file types using the Advanced Encryption Standard ( aka Rijndael ) .



It then encrypts that key with RSA 2048 - bit encryption to make the files utterly unrecoverable .



As of Friday morning , Atlanta ’s main website and its affiliated portals remained unaffected by the ransomware attack .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security are investigating the cyberattack , which Atlanta Information Management officials learned of Thursday at 5:40 a.m. , Cox said .



DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency offered technical expertise and support and referred questions to the city .



The city announced outages earlier Thursday to various customer - facing applications , including those used to pay bills and access court - related information .

The city 's payroll has not been affected , he said .



Public safety and water services are operating without incident .



The city engaged Microsoft and a team from Cisco 's Incident Response Services in the investigation , Deputy Chief Information Officer Daphne Rackley said .



When asked if the city was aware of vulnerabilities and failed to take action , Rackley said the city had implemented measures in the past that might have lessened the scope of the breach .



She cited a " cloud strategy " to migrate critical systems to secure infrastructure .



" This is not a new issue to the state of Georgia , it 's not a new issue to our country .



We have been taking active measures to mitigate any risk in the past .



" In the meantime , the mayor urged caution . "



We do n't know if it 's limited to information related to just our employees or if it 's more extensive than that .



But because we do n't know I think that it would be appropriate for the public just to be vigilant in checking their accounts and making sure your credit agencies also have been notified .

In a paper slated for presentation at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May , McCoy and a team including researchers from the University of California , San Diego ; Princeton University ; Google ; and the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis provide the first detailed account of the ransomware payment ecosystem , from initial attack to cash - out .



Key findings include the discovery that South Koreans are disproportionately impacted by ransomware campaigns , with analysis revealing that $ 2.5 million of the $ 16 million in ransomware payments tracked by the researchers was paid in South Korea .

The paper 's authors call for additional research to determine the reason that so many South Koreans are victimized and how they can be protected .



The team also found that most ransomware operators used a Russian bitcoin exchange , BTC - E , to convert bitcoin to fiat currencies .



( BTC - E has since been seized by the FBI . )



The researchers estimate that at least 20,000 individuals made ransomware payments over the past two years , at a confirmed cost of $ 16 million , although the actual payment total is likely far higher .

McCoy and his collaborators took advantage of the public nature of the bitcoin blockchain technology to trace ransom payments over a two - year period ¬ .

Bitcoins are the most common currency of ransomware payments , and because most victims do not own them , the initial bitcoin purchase provides a starting point for tracking payments .

The research team tapped public reports of ransomware attacks to identify these addresses and correlate them with blockchain transactions .

To boost the number of transactions available for analysis , the team also executed real ransomware binaries in a controlled experimental environment , essentially becoming victims themselves and making micropayments to real ransom wallets in order to follow the bitcoin trail .



" Ransomware operators ultimately direct bitcoin to a central account that they cash out periodically , and by injecting a little bit of our own money into the larger flow we could identify those central accounts , see the other payments flowing in , and begin to understand the number of victims and the amount of money being collected , " McCoy said .



The research team acknowledged that ethical issues prevent exploration of certain aspects of the ransomware ecosystem , including determining the percentage of victims who actually pay to recover their files .

22,23 person|25,26 ransom|22,26 r_victim

McCoy explained that despite having the ability to check for activity connected to a specific payment address , doing so would effectively " start the clock " and potentially cause victims to either pay a double ransom or lose the opportunity to recover their files altogether .

30,31 person|33,37 ransom|30,37 r_victim

Criminal use of cryptocurrencies is one of McCoy 's research focuses .



He and fellow researchers previously tracked human traffickers through their use of Bitcoin advertising .



Cryptojacking attacks exploded by 8,500 % in 2017 resulting from the sudden increase in cryptocurrency values .



According to research released by Symantec , UK ranked as the fifth highest country worldwide , with a staggering 44,000 % increase in coin - miner detections .



With a low barrier to entry – only requiring a couple lines of code to operate – cyber-criminals are harnessing stolen processing power and cloud CPU usage from consumers and enterprises to mine cryptocurrency .



Coin - miners can slow devices , overheat batteries , and in some cases , render devices unusable .



For enterprise organizations , coin - miners can put corporate networks at risk of shutdown and inflate cloud CPU usage , adding cost .



Symantec also found a 600 % increase in overall IoT attacks in 2017 , which means that cyber-criminals could exploit the connected nature of these devices to mine en masse .



“ Attackers could be co-opting your phone , computer or IoT device to use them for profit , ” said Darren Thomson , CTO and VP EMEA , Symantec .



“ People need to expand their defences or they will pay the price for someone else using their device . ”



The Annual Threat Report also showed that while ransomware was still being used in 2017 , there were fewer ransomware families and lower ransom demands .
19,21 malware|14,15 time|8,13 capabilities|23,25 ransom|19,24 r_tool|19,25 r_tool|20,24 r_tool|20,25 r_tool|14,24 r_time|14,25 r_time|8,24 r_attack-pattern|8,25 r_attack-pattern|9,24 r_attack-pattern|9,25 r_attack-pattern|10,24 r_attack-pattern|10,25 r_attack-pattern|11,24 r_attack-pattern|11,25 r_attack-pattern|12,24 r_attack-pattern|12,25 r_attack-pattern
19,21 malware|14,15 time|8,13 capabilities|23,25 ransom|19,25 r_tool|14,25 r_time|8,25 r_attack-pattern

Symantec outlined in its report that “ many cyber-criminals may have shifted their focus to coin mining as an alternative to cash in while cryptocurrency values are high ” and that “ some online banking threats have also experienced a renaissance as established ransomware groups have attempted to diversify . ”



Last year , the average ransom demand dropped to $ 522 , less than half the average of the year prior .
9,11 money|0,2 time|5,7 ransom|5,10 price|5,11 price|6,10 price|6,11 price|0,6 r_time|0,7 r_time|1,6 r_time|1,7 r_time
9,11 money|0,2 time|5,7 ransom|5,11 price|0,7 r_time

While the number of ransomware variants increased by 46 % , indicating the established criminal groups are still quite productive , the number of ransomware families dropped , suggesting they are innovating less and may have shifted their focus to new , higher value targets .



The report analyzed data from the Symantec Global Intelligence Network , which tracks over 700,000 global adversaries , records events from 98 million attack sensors worldwide and monitors threat activities in over 157 countries and territories .



Threats in the mobile space continued to grow year - over-year , including the number of new mobile malware variants which increased by 54 % .



According to the report , Symantec blocked an average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications each day last year , citing older operating systems as one of the main causes - only 20 % of devices are running the newest version of Android .



Mobile users also face privacy risks from ' grayware ' apps that are n’t completely malicious but can be troublesome - Symantec found that 63 % of grayware apps leak the device ’s phone number .



Unfortunately , with grayware increasing by 20 % in 2017 , Symantec do not believe this problem will be going away .



BT MAIL users should be on alert as a new email scam is discovered which could be used to gain access to personal details .

Users of BT ’s popular email service should be aware of a new scam which is targeting customers across the UK .



The latest threat , which was unleashed over the weekend , suggests that customers ’ bills are overdue and need to be paid as soon as possible .



The full message reads , “ Your latest bill is now overdue .



You can view it online at My BT or on the app .



To log in , you 'll need your BT ID .



This is usually your email address .



“ You need to pay it as soon as possible to avoid service intreruption ! ”



This scam then attempts to trick users by suggesting they should click a link to pay their outstanding bill .

There ’s plenty of warning signs about this message including obvious spelling errors and the fact there ’s no official BT branding on the email .



Another reason why this is clearly a fake is that it 's been sent to people who do n't even use BT as their email provider .

In a tweet Warwickshire Police said they had “ received an email from BT re an outstanding bill today - there are links on it to pay the bill .



" This is an obvious scam , " the message on Twitter continued .



" Please if you receive a similar one DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINKS - BT have been made aware . "



Express.co.uk has contacted BT for comment on this latest scam .



BT has plenty of advice on its website about staying safe online .



The broadband supplier states that internet scams can take many forms , from ' phishing ' , where a fake email or web site will try to get you to part with your bank account information , to scams pretending to be from online auction , job or other websites that try to collect your personal data .

The security company CTS Labs gave AMD less than 24 hours notice before releasing the information to the public .



Standard vulnerability disclosure practices call for giving companies at least 90 days ' notice so they can fix the flaws before researchers go public and hackers can start causing trouble .

" We believe this provides a good example of why the more standard 90 - day notification window for such notifications exist . "



In the original vulnerability report , CTS Labs said that it would take " several months " to fix the issues and that some hardware flaws " can not be fixed . "
19,21 vulnerability|14,16 time|23,26 vulnerability|1,5 discover-vulnerability|18,19 patch-vulnerability|27,31 patch-vulnerability|18,20 vulnerability|18,21 vulnerability|14,19 r_time|15,19 r_time|23,28 r_vulnerability|23,29 r_vulnerability|23,30 r_vulnerability|23,31 r_vulnerability|24,28 r_vulnerability|24,29 r_vulnerability|24,30 r_vulnerability|24,31 r_vulnerability|25,28 r_vulnerability|25,29 r_vulnerability|25,30 r_vulnerability|25,31 r_vulnerability

According to AMD 's technical assessment , each of the flaws required administrative access .



" Any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research , " Papermaster said in a statement .



Critics also took issue with another aspect of the CTS Labs report , pointing out the legal disclaimer on the company 's website : " You are advised that we may have , either directly or indirectly , an economic interest in the performance of the securities of the companies whose products are the subject of our reports . "



Last Wednesday , CTS Labs ' chief financial officer and co-founder , Yaron Luk - Zilberman , a former hedge fund manager , said it did n't have " any investment ( long or short ) in Intel or AMD . "



Popular travel - booking site Orbitz has likely been hacked , potentially exposing payment card information for people that bought plane tickets or booked hotel rooms over the course of two years .

The company said that it has uncovered evidence that about 880,000 payment cards were possibly impacted , along with other personal information , like names , payment card information , dates of birth , phone numbers , email addresses , physical and / or billing addresses and gender .



The company said evidence suggests an attacker may have accessed information stored on a legacy e-commerce platform during two periods : 1 January through 22 June 2016 and 1 October to 22 December 2017 .

We deeply regret the incident , and we are committed to doing everything we can to maintain the trust of our customers and partners .



" Mike Schuricht , vice president of product management at Bitglass , said that the issue may have arisen as an artifact of the acquisition integration .



Expedia bought the company in September 2015 .



“ Any organization that is acquired by or is acquiring another business and its IT assets typically has a major blind spot with respect to its legacy or nonproduction systems , ” Schuricht said via email .



“ As is the case with most audits and postmortems in the event of a breach , Expedia is likely looking back at the infrastructure affiliated with its prior acquisitions , like Travelocity , to ensure all of its owned databases are not similarly impacted .



It ’s always a concern when an organization only becomes aware of a breach months or years after it takes place – highlighting the inadequacy of reactive security solutions and auditing processes . ”



Orbitz is offering customers a year of free credit monitoring ; yet Nathan Wenzler , chief security strategist at San Francisco - based security consulting company AsTech , said that more is needed .



“ Another day , another breach .



And while the attackers show no signs of slowing down , companies really need to do more than just provide users a free year of credit monitoring services and consider their work done , ” he said via email .



“ Legacy systems are common attack points , as they are often neglected , go without updates or patches and are commonly not monitored , which gives criminals an ideal avenue to gain access and steal whatever data may be resident there .

In this case , it was nearly 900,000 credit card accounts .



Credit monitoring may be a nice PR gesture , but it does not absolve companies from doing their due diligence around securing legacy systems and protecting their customers data , no matter where it lives . ”

In a blog post authored by AMD ’s chief technical officer , Mark Papermaster , AMD confirmed that the four broad classifications of attacks — Masterkey , Ryzenfall , Fallout , and Chimera — are viable , though they require administrative access to the PC or server in question .



Third - party protection , such as Microsoft Windows Credential Guard , also serve to block unauthorized administrative access , Papermaster wrote .



In any event , “ any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research , ” AMD ’s Papermaster added .



But AMD also provided the answer to consumers ’ most pressing question : What , if anything , needs to be done ?



For each of the first three classifications of vulnerabilities , AMD said it is working on firmware updates that the company plans to release during the coming weeks .

AMD has neither confirmed nor denied whether the attacks can be executed remotely , or require local access .



AMD did deny , however , that the attacks have anything to do with Meltdown or Spectre , the two side - channel attacks that rival Intel has worked to patch .

About a week ago , CTS - Labs issued a press release as well as a website outlining the vulnerabilities , which the company provided to AMD less than 24 hours before CTS - Labs went public , AMD said .



But CTS - Labs also drew fire over boilerplate copy on its website that implied a potential financial interest in the subjects of its reports .



PCWorld attempted to interview CTS executives , but later rescinded that request after CTS - Labs representatives demanded a list of questions in advance , and also forbade us from asking about the timing and the company ’s financial motivations .



In the meantime , however , the vulnerabilities were confirmed by two independent researchers , Trail of Bits and Check Point .

“ Teenagers today are constantly connected and sharing all aspects of their daily life is normal as there is a lot of peer pressure to participate in social apps , ” said Sanjay Kalra , co-founder and chief product officer at Lacework , a provider of cloud security solutions .



“ Being a parent of [ a ] teenager in this hyper - social environment is a scary aspect .



You can not control information once exposed .



Parents should be in constant communication with their teenagers , explaining the risks associated with information sharing and training them on basics of internet security .



They should be educating them on how to use multiple strong passwords , anonymization of the data and identities and long - term effects of having personal aspects of life in public domain . ”



Small and medium businesses across Europe are being actively targeted by ransomware attacks , new research has shown .
11,13 ransom
11,13 ransom

According to data protection firm Datto , 87 % of European IT service providers it surveyed said their SMB customers had been hit by a ransomware attack at some point during the previous 12 months .

Additionally , 40 % of respondents reported multiple attacks during that time .



Just over a quarter of respondents ( 27 % ) reported experiencing multiple attacks in a single day .



In terms of the impact these attacks are having , the survey revealed the average ransom demanded was between £ 500 and £ 2000 .

In 15 % of reported cases the demand was in excess of £ 2000 .



Nearly half ( 47 % ) said paying the ransom was ineffective , as they still lost some of the data that had been encrypted by the attackers .

A majority of respondents ( 62 % ) said they ’d experienced downtime during the attack .



For smaller organizations , the combination of financial loss and downtime can threaten the continued operation of the business , Datto said .



Frustratingly , just 40 % of ransomware victims end up reporting the crime to the authorities .



The FBI has previously said that reporting ransomware attacks will help it get a better understanding of exactly how many attacks are occurring as well as help the industry develop its defenses ; traditional antivirus has so far proved to be ineffectual against most ransomware .

“ Ransomware is more than just a nuisance ; it ’s a major money - making operation backed by professional and well - funded organizations , ” said Andrew Stuart , managing director , EMEA at Datto .



It ’s tax season , and that means con artists and scammers are out in full force trying to capitalize on people ’s financial anxieties .



The IRS puts out strong warnings each year — often republishing its “’ Dirty Dozen ’ list of tax scams ” several times between January and April .



This year , phishing schemes — in which scammers send emails pretending to be from the IRS in order to trick people into divulging sensitive information — topped the list .

Being cautious and taking basic security steps can help protect people and their sensitive tax and financial data . ”



Threat researchers at Zscaler published a blog on March 15 outlining four new phishing schemes they identified during this tax season , most of which used fake IRS websites to steal taxpayers ’ information .

“ Cybercriminals have long used social engineering and phishing techniques to lure unsuspecting users into giving away private information , ” the researchers wrote .

“ They track current trends and events to make their attacks more effective , and tax season offers a rich opportunity for attackers to disguise themselves as well - known brands and even government agencies in an effort to exploit users . ”

This tendency is on display with the “ chalbhai ” phishing attack , which uses a spoof of an outdated IRS form to trick users into giving up their tax identification information , which can then be used to file false returns .

While studying this campaign , researchers noticed the term “ chalbhai ” used in the source code .



“ We have typically seen this tag associated with phishing pages that look like Microsoft Office 365 , Apple ID , Dropbox or DocuSign , ” Zscaler wrote .

“ This is a good example of criminals adapting their phishing content to reflect current trends , ” i.e. , tax season .



Another similar scheme directed users to a fake IRS page for unlocking expired passwords .



Researchers noted this campaign was particularly tricky , as users were redirected to a legitimate IRS page after giving up their information .

“ With this page , ” they wrote , “ the attacker is attempting to prevent user suspicion by redirecting the user from this phishing page to a legitimate e-policy statement hosted on the actual IRS page … At this point , the victims believe they have completed the account unlock process and they proceed to log in on the legitimate page unaware that their information has been stolen . ”

Researchers also found similar tactics used to get taxpayers ’ logins for tax preparer sites like TurboTax .



In a fourth example , Zscaler researchers found an encrypted phishing page designed to mask their ill - intent from security measures .



After a user downloads the page , it is decrypted within the browser , skirting some security checks .



In all these examples , users could have avoided the scam by double - checking the URL in the browser , which all included additional characters before the .



gov domain , indicating users were not actually at an official IRS site .

Now it ’s out there , it ’s a race against time to make sure you are n’t an easy target for an attacker who wants to try and kick the tires on this vulnerability .



Obviously , patch as soon as possible and please follow Microsoft ’s guidance carefully : Mitigation consists of installing the update on all eligible client and server operating systems and then using included Group Policy settings or registry - based equivalents to manage the setting options on the client and server computers .



We recommend that administrators apply the policy and set it to “ Force updated clients ” or “ Mitigated ” on client and server computers as soon as possible .



These changes will require a reboot of the affected systems .



Pay close attention to Group Policy or registry settings pairs that result in “ Blocked ” interactions between clients and servers in the compatibility table later in this article .



Both the “ Force updated clients ” and “ Mitigated ” settings prevent RDP clients from falling back to insecure versions of CredSSP .



The “ Force updated clients ” setting will not allow services that use CredSSP to accept unpatched clients but “ Mitigated ” will .

Samba is a free , open source interoperability suite that extends Windows file and print services to Unix and Linux machines .



Businesses that run Unix / Linux and Windows side by side frequently use Samba to link the two operating systems together , making any risk to the security and stability of Samba a serious risk .



The vulnerabilities in question , CVE -2018-1050 and CVE -2018-1057 , are both serious risks for anyone using Samba .
1,2 vulnerability|5,7 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|8,10 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|2,4 discover-vulnerability|1,3 r_vulnerability|1,4 r_vulnerability|2,6 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|2,7 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|3,6 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|3,7 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|2,9 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|2,10 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|3,9 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures|3,10 common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures

If your business has a Samba implementation it 's highly recommended that you install the applicable security updates .



What the Samba vulnerabilities can do The first vulnerability , 1050 , affects all Samba instances version 4.0.0 and up .
6,9 vulnerability|13,15 system|16,20 version|12,13 discover-vulnerability|6,13 r_vulnerability|7,13 r_vulnerability|8,13 r_vulnerability|12,14 vulnerable-system|12,15 vulnerable-system|12,17 vulnerable-system-version|12,18 vulnerable-system-version|12,19 vulnerable-system-version|12,20 vulnerable-system-version
6,9 vulnerability|13,15 system|16,20 version|12,13 discover-vulnerability|6,13 r_vulnerability|12,15 vulnerable-system|12,20 vulnerable-system-version

More specifically , it only affects version 4.0.0 and up Samba installations that are also running their Remote Procedure Call ( RPC ) Spool Subsystem Service ( spoolss ) as an external daemon ( RPC spoolss is configured to internal by default ) .
10,12 system|3,4 vulnerability|6,10 version|5,6 discover-vulnerability|5,11 vulnerable-system|5,12 vulnerable-system|3,6 r_vulnerability|5,7 vulnerable-system-version|5,8 vulnerable-system-version|5,9 vulnerable-system-version|5,10 vulnerable-system-version
10,12 system|3,4 vulnerability|6,10 version|5,6 discover-vulnerability|5,12 vulnerable-system|3,6 r_vulnerability|5,10 vulnerable-system-version

If the RPC spoolss misses an input sanitization check it can cause the print spooler to crash , effectively killing the ability for anyone using Samba to send files to a printer .



The second vulnerability , 1057 , is a far greater risk to Samba security .
0,3 vulnerability
0,3 vulnerability

Like 1050 , it affects all Samba installations version 4.0.0 and up and allows users to change the passwords of other users , including those with admin rights .

3,4 vulnerability|6,8 system|13,22 capabilities|8,12 version|4,5 discover-vulnerability|3,5 r_vulnerability|4,8 vulnerable-system|4,22 capabilities|4,12 vulnerable-system-version

1057 's problem stems from a problem with how Samba Active Directory domain controllers handle permission validations using the lightweight directory access protocol ( LDAP ) .



" The LDAP server incorrectly validates certain LDAP password modifications against the ' Change Password ' privilege , but then performs a password reset operation , " Samba said .



This vulnerability only affects Samba installations being used as Active Directory domain controllers , so those using Samba in non-domain control roles do n't need to be concerned .
0,2 vulnerability|4,6 system|3,4 discover-vulnerability|0,4 r_vulnerability|1,4 r_vulnerability|3,5 vulnerable-system|3,6 vulnerable-system
0,2 vulnerability|4,6 system|3,4 discover-vulnerability|0,4 r_vulnerability|3,6 vulnerable-system

If you are using Samba as an AD DC and ca n't install the security patch yet , there is a workaround Samba says you can put in place as a temporary protection measure : revoking password change permissions for " the world " group .



EdgeWave , Inc. ® , a leading provider in cybersecurity and compliance , today revealed a new , malicious exploit embedded in popular URL shorteners , which are being mistaken as legitimate URLs .
18,20 vulnerability|0,1 organization|23,25 system|28,33 capabilities|13,14 time|14,15 discover-vulnerability|14,19 vulnerability|14,20 vulnerability|0,15 r_discoverer|14,24 vulnerable-system|14,25 vulnerable-system|14,29 capabilities|14,30 capabilities|14,31 capabilities|14,32 capabilities|14,33 capabilities|13,15 r_time

URL shorteners may be susceptible to this new exploit when a change is allowed to the long URL after the shortened URL is created .



The malicious parties fabricate an email that appears to be a legitimate marketing email which includes the shortened URL --- passing by any in - transit virus scanning and potentially other spam checking tools .

" Several days ago , we detected this new exploit while performing our real - time , human analysis on spam campaigns , " said Blake Tullysmith , Principal Engineer at EdgeWave .
9,10 vulnerability|5,6 organization|1,4 time|6,7 discover-vulnerability|6,10 vulnerability|5,7 r_discoverer|1,7 r_time|2,7 r_time|3,7 r_time
9,10 vulnerability|5,6 organization|1,4 time|6,7 discover-vulnerability|6,10 vulnerability|5,7 r_discoverer|1,7 r_time

" With over 100 million URLs being shortened per day , this new exploit can potentially impact billions of users across email and social media campaigns . "



Here is how the EdgeWave ePrism team explains the exploit : Some URL shorteners will allow users to change the long URL after they have already created the shortened URL .



The malicious parties will then fabricate a seemingly legitimate email and include a shortened URL that passes in - transit virus scanning as well as other filtering solutions , which will allow the shortened URL to be delivered right into the inbox .
6,10 file|12,15 website|1,3 organization|5,6 phishing|5,7 tool|5,8 tool|5,9 tool|5,10 tool|5,13 trusted-entity|5,14 trusted-entity|5,15 trusted-entity|1,6 r_attacker|2,6 r_attacker
6,10 file|12,15 website|1,3 organization|5,6 phishing|5,10 tool|5,15 trusted-entity|1,6 r_attacker

Once the spam campaign is embedded in the message , the URL is redirected to a site that contains malicious content like a virus or malware .



However , the delivered message is already in the inbox ; so unfortunately , there is no protection at this point .



Attached is an image of a sample email message extracted from an email campaign while in - transit with a link from http://tiny.cc pointing to a clean website .



After the campaign was delivered , it points to a compromised website including malicious content .



The EdgeWave team is still conducting further investigations on this exploit and recommends all URL shortening users utilize services that do not allow the URL to be edited after its creation .



EdgeWave customers are being protected by its ePrism Email Security solution .



EdgeWave ePrism is an award - winning , hosted cloud email security solution with Zero - Minute Defense against phishing , spam and malware campaigns using our unique combination of automated intelligence and 24/7/365 human analysis in a simple - to - use security suite for all email compliance and business needs .



Staff are still falling for phishing scams , with social media friend requests and emails pretending to come from the HR department among the ones most likely to fool workers into handing over usernames and passwords .

It 's a technique used by the lowliest criminals as part of ransomware campaigns , right up to state - backed hackers because it continues to be such an effective method .



In a review of 100 simulated attack campaigns for 48 of its clients , accounting for almost a million individual users , security company MWR Infosecurity found that sending a bogus friend request was the best way to get someone to click on a link -- even when the email was being sent to a work email address .

Some might argue that gaining access to a staff email account is of limited use , but the security company argues that this is a handy for an assault .

Even basic security controls , such as two - factor authentication or disabling file and SharePoint remote access , could reduce the risk .



The company also reported bad news about the passwords that users handed over : while over 60 percent of passwords were found to have a length of 8 to 10 characters -- the mandatory minimum for many organizations -- the company argued that this illustrates how users stick to minimum security requirements .



A third of the passwords consisted of an upper - case first letter , a series of lower - case letters , and then numbers with no symbols .



It also found that 13.6 percent of passwords ended with four numbers in the range of 1940 to 2040 .



Of those , nearly half ended in 2016 , which means one - in - twenty of all passwords end with the year in which they were created .



Global software industry advocate BSA | The Software Alliance is warning Australian organisations to be mindful of the security risks involved with using unlicensed software after it settled with a record number of infringement settlements last year .



A total of 28 case settlements for the use of unlicensed software occurred in 2017 – twice the amount in 2016 .



The 28 settlements were worth more than $ 347,000 in damages against businesses across Australia .



BSA warns that with the Notifiable Data Breaches legislation now in effect , this is a good time for organisations to consider the risks unlicensed software bring to their business .

One of the 28 settlements involved a Western Australia - based energy company that was found using unlicensed software .



The settlement amounted to more than $ 40,000 .



Every business caught using unlicensed software had to purchase genuine software licenses for ongoing use on top of the copyright infringement damages .



“ It ’s especially important that organisations are ensuring they ’re doing all they can to protect their data given the recent introduction of NDB legislation .



In order to stay on top of their software licensing , businesses should consider investing in SAM tools .



The potential consequences faced by businesses that are found to be using unlicensed software far outweighs the cost of investment into SAM , something that all businesses should be considering , ” Gan continues .



The BSA continues to clamp down on unlawful use of its members ’ software .



Members include Adobe , Apple , IBM , Microsoft , Okta , Oracle , Symantec , Trend Micro and Workday , amongst others .



BSA offers up to $ 20,000 to eligible recipients who disclose accurate information regarding unlawful copying or use of BSA members ’ software .



Potential recipients must provide assistance and evidence to support the information , as may be required by the BSA ’s legal advisers , in connection with any claim or legal proceedings initiated by the BSA members .



BSA says it remains committed to its role in raising awareness of the risks to businesses when using unlicensed software and the damaging effects that software piracy has on the Australian IT industry .



Researchers found they were able to infect robots with ransomware ; in the real world , such attacks could be highly damaging to businesses if robotic security is n't addressed .



Ransomware has long been a headache for PC and smartphone users , but in the future , it could be robots that stop working unless a ransom is paid .

Researchers at security company IOActive have shown how they managed to hack the humanoid NAO robot made by Softbank and infect one with custom - built ransomware .



The researchers said the same attack would work on the Pepper robot too .



After the infection , the robot is shown insulting its audience and demanding to be ' fed ' bitcoin cryptocurrency in order to restore systems back to normal .

While a tiny robot making threats might initially seem amusing -- if a little creepy -- the proof - of - concept attack demonstrates the risks associated with a lack of security in robots and how organisations that employ robots could suddenly see parts of their business grind to a halt should they become a victim of ransomware .



" In order to get a business owner to pay a ransom to a hacker , you could make robots stop working .

And , because the robots are directly tied to production and services , when they stop working they 'll cause a financial problem for the owner , losing money every second they 're not working , " Cesar Cerrudo , CTO at IOActive Labs , told ZDNet .



Taking what was learned in previous studies into the security vulnerabilities of robots , researchers were able to inject and run code in Pepper and NAO robots and take complete control of the systems , giving them the option to shut the robot down or modify its actions .



The researchers said it was possible for an attacker with access to the Wi - Fi network the robot is running on to inject malicious code into the machine .



" The attack can come from a computer or other device that is connected to internet , so a computer gets hacked , and from there , the robot can be hacked since it 's in the same network as the hacked computer , " said Cerrudo , who conducted the research alongside Lucas Apa , Senior Security Consultant at IOActive .



Unlike computers , robots do n't yet store vast amounts of valuable information that the user might be willing to pay a ransom to retrieve .

14,16 person|20,23 ransom|14,23 r_victim

But , as companies often do n't have backups to restore systems from , if a robot becomes infected with ransomware , it 's almost impossible for the user to restore it to normal by themselves .



If the alternative for a victim of robot ransomware is waiting for a technician to come to fix the robot -- or even losing access it to weeks if it needs to be returned to the manufacturer -- a business owner might view giving into the ransom demand as a lesser evil .

" If it 's one robot then it could take less time , but if there are dozens or more , every second they are n't working , the business is losing money .



Keeping this in mind , shipping lots of robots takes a lot of time , so the financial impact is bigger when you have a computer compromised with ransomware , " said Cerrudo .



While the robot ransomware infections have been done for the purposes of research -- and presented at the 2018 Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit in Cancun , Mexico -- IOActive warn that if security in robotics is n't properly addressed now , there could be big risks in the near future .



" While we do n't see robots every day , they 're going mainstream soon , businesses worldwide are deploying robots for different services .



If we do n't start making robots secure now , if more get out there which are easily hacked , there are very serious consequences , " said Cerrudo .



As with security vulnerabilities the Internet of Things and other products , the solution to this issue is for robotics manufacturers to think about cybersecurity at every step of the manufacturing process from day one .



IOActive informed Softbank about the research in January but Cerrudo said : " We do n't know if they [ Softbank ] are going to fix the issues and when , or even if they can fix the issues with the current design . "

Responding to the IOActive research , a Softbank spokesperson told ZDNet : " We will continue to improve our security measures on Pepper , so we can counter any risks we may face . "



Although Robert Herjavec , an investor on ABC 's " Shark Tank , " expects the price of bitcoin to " skyrocket , " he has no plans to personally buy any .



That 's because as the CEO of cybersecurity firm Herjavec Group , he does n't want to support the growing trend of hackers using cryptocurrency .



" I ca n't invest in something that my enemy uses as funds , " he explained on CNBC 's " Squawk Alley . "



Indeed , " If there was no cryptocurrency , much of the large hacks that we 're seeing today would n't exist , " Herjavec told Money .



As one example , Herjavec is concerned with the role cryptocurrency plays in ransomware attacks .
13,15 ransom

" Cryptocurrency permits anonymity , " he explains to CNBC Make It .



" It 's a very popular form of payment for ransomware in particular . "



Ransomware is a type of software that locks or encrypts a computer user 's data and files , in affect holding it hostage .

That 's because a bitcoin wallet is only identified by a number , and " payments are direct without a bank or credit card company acting as the middle man , " Herjavec says .



" There is no money trail , so it 's very difficult to track back to an individual . "



With WannaCry , the hackers asked for $ 300 worth of bitcoin from victims , and if they waited over 72 hours to pay , the fine increased to $ 600 .

And one out of five businesses that do pay the ransom do n’t get their data back , according to 2016 report by Kaspersky Labs .

It ’s a growing business for cybercriminals .



And whether to pay or not is something each user or company must decide .



Last spring , the Erie County Medical Center in New York was attacked by SamSam due to a misconfigured web server , according to The Buffalo News .

Because it had backed up its files , the hospital decided not to pay the estimated $ 44,000 ransom .

It took six weeks to get back to normal at a recovery cost of nearly $ 10 million .



More recently in January , the new SamSam variant sneaked into Indiana hospital Hancock Health , which decided to pay 4 bitcoin , or about $ 55,000 , in ransom .

The hospital was back online by Monday morning .



Other times , malware is n’t so obvious .



Some propagate when user visits infected websites .



A trojan named Poweliks injected bad code into vulnerable programs , like an unpatched Internet Explorer .



Poweliks crept into the Windows registry to force the computer to do all sorts of nasty things , from demanding a ransom to joining a click - fraud bot network to click ads without the user even realizing it .

There also are booby - trapped ads , known as malvertising .



They get into computers by , again , targeting flawed software and injecting malicious code .



This has targeted programs like unpatched Adobe Flash Player , Java or other runtime software , or software that runs online all the time .



DDoS extortionists have already pounced on the Memcached DDoS attack vector in attempts to extract payments from attacked companies .

Akamai revealed earlier today that it detected DDoS attacks executed via Memcached servers that were different from others .



Instead of blasting targets with UDP packets containing random data , one group of attackers is leaving short messages inside these packets .



This one group is asking victims to pay 50 Monero — around $ 17,000 — to a Monero address .

The group does n't say it will stop the attack but only implies it .



Such attacks have first appeared in 2015 and were initially referred to as DDoS - for - Bitcoin after the DD4BTC group that pioneered such tactics .



The group would send emails to various companies , threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless they paid a ransom fee .

Even if the group 's members were arrested , other factions appeared in subsequent years , using unique names such as Armada Collective or XMR Squad , but also mimicking hacker groups such as Anonymous or LulzSec .



The tactic , now known as ransom DDoS ( RDoS ) , has become quite popular among cybercriminal groups , and there have been too many RDoS campaigns to remember in the past years .

But according to Daniel Smith , a Radware security researcher who spoke with Bleeping Computer , paying the Monero ransom wo n't help companies at all.That 's because attackers have used the same Monero address for multiple DDoS attacks against different targets .

A GandCrab ransomware decryption tool has been released as part of the No More Ransom initiative , following a combined operation by Bitdefender , the Romanian Police , the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism ( DIICOT ) and Europol .



GandGrab first appeared in January and has already claimed over 53,000 victims around the world , making it what Europol describe as " one of the most aggressive forms of ransomware so far this year " costing each victim anything from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand .

This variant of the file - locking malware is unusual in a number of ways : not only is it spread via the use of exploit kits - a tactic usually reserved for the likes of trojans and cryptocurrency miners - it is also the first form of ransomware to ask for payments in Dash .

The spread of GandGrab has also been helped along by a cybercrime - as - a-service scheme which offers a toolkit for deploying the ransomware in exchange for wannabee crooks giving the original authors a cut of their profits .



It 's unknown which specific cybercriminal operation is behind GandGrab .



However , the ransomware is advertised on Russian hacking forums , with the authors explicitly instructing those who become a part of the partnership scheme not to target Russia or any other country in the Commonwealth of Independent States of former Soviet republics .



But regardless of who might be distributing GandCrab , now victims do n't need to pay a ransom to those looking to cash in on it , because the decryption tool is available for free from the No More Ransom portal and from Bitdefender .

" Ransomware has become a billion - dollar cash cow for malware authors , and GandCrab is one of the highest bidders , " said Catalin Cosoi , senior director of the investigation and forensics unit at Bitdefender .



In order to help prevent falling victim to ransomware , Bitdefender recommends regularly back - up sensitive data and to be wary of suspicious email attachments and malicious links .



Launched in 2016 , the No More Ransom scheme brings law enforcement and private industry together in the fight against cybercrime and has helped thousands of ransomware victims retrieve their encrypted files without lining the pockets of crooks .

The portal is available in 29 languages and since its launch has has received over 1.6 million visitors from a total of 180 countries .



The release of GandCrab decryption tools comes shortly after an operation involving Europol , the Belgian National Police and Kaspersky Lab led to the release of free decryption tools for Cryakl ransomware .



The Colorado Department of Transportation ( DOT ) has shut down over 2,000 computers after some systems got infected with the SamSam ransomware on Wednesday , February 21 .



The agency 's IT staff is working with its antivirus provider McAfee to remediate affected workstations and safeguard other endpoints before before reintroducing PCs into its network .



DOT officials told local press [ 1 , 2 ] that crucial systems were not affected , such as those managing road surveillance cameras , traffic alerts , message boards , and others .



The agency 's Twitter feed continued to show traffic alerts after the agency shut down much of its employees ' IT network .



Colorado DOT will not pay the ransom In a rare sign of transparency , officials revealed the name of the ransomware — SamSam .

SamSam ransomware making a comeback The SamSam ransomware is a ransomware strain that 's been deployed by a single group .



Infection occurs after attackers gain access to a company 's internal networks by brute - forcing RDP connections .



Attackers then try to gain access to as many computers on the same network as possible , on which they manually run the SamSam ransomware to encrypt files .



In the recent campaigns , SamSam operators usually asked for a 1 Bitcoin ransom and left a message of " I 'm sorry " on victims ' computers .

The SamSam group had been previously active in the winter of 2016 but have come back with new attacks .



These new attacks have been detailed in reports published by Bleeping Computer , Secureworks , and Cisco Talos .



Colorado investigators call in FBI , work through the night .



Colorado Department of Transportation employees spent a second day offline Thursday as security officials investigated the damage done by a ransomware virus that hijacked computer files and demanded payment in bitcoin for their safe return .

On Wednesday morning , CDOT shut down more than 2,000 employee computers while security officials investigated the attack .



The malicious code was a variant of ransomware known as SamSam , Simmons said .



McAfee , the security software used by CDOT computers , provided a software patch on Wednesday to stop the execution of the ransomware .

Teams will continue to monitor the situation closely and will be working into the night , ” said David McCurdy , chief technology officer , Governor ’s Office of Information Technology , in a statement on Wednesday .



He added : “ OIT , FBI and other security agencies are working together to determine a root cause analysis . ”



SamSam last showed up in January after targeting the healthcare industry .



It encrypted files and renamed them “ I ’m sorry , ” according to a report with security firm TrendMicro .



One hospital , Hancock Health in Indiana , paid $ 55,000 to get its files back .

Google ’s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is often criticized and applauded in equal measure .



There ’s plenty of evidence to suggest security vulnerabilities are increasing in Windows and across the industry , and Microsoft has clearly struggled to fix these two issues with plenty of notice .

It can also be argued that Google is making rival software more secure with its efforts , making everyone ’s software secure .



However , Google also has competitive commercial interests , and Project Zero has been unusually aggressive in finding and publishing new vulnerabilities .



Reports suggest Google ’s Project Zero security team originated from the fallout around the 2009 Google hack , an intrusion blamed on an unpatched flaw in Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer 6 browser .



Google makes exceptions to its strict rules , with grace periods , and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited .

What was most remarkable about the CSI report was that the problems that affect on premises infrastructure are the same ones that affect cloud infrastructure .



The difference is that most organizations have learned over the years to provide at least some level of protection for their on premises infrastructure and assets .



Unfortunately , it appears that the same is n’t true of their cloud resources .



Part of the problem , it appears , comes from a lack of familiarity with managing cloud services .



But security for those services does exist is readily available .



Amazon , for example regularly sends out emails to AWS users explaining what security measures , products and services are available for its cloud environments .



Unlike private , on - premises environments , the public cloud is just that — public .



That means it can be accessed by anyone , including an attacker that possesses the credentials that can enable access from anywhere .



What that means is that access security is even more important , because you have no means of preventing a criminal from trying to gain access .



But it also means that monitoring your cloud environment is just as important as your on premises physical environment .



Monitoring at least provides a way to find an attacker that ’s gotten past your access controls .



The CSI team also recommends a “ deny all ” setting on your firewall for outbound cloud traffic , and setting your cloud so that configuration changes are automatically reported .



The key here is to remember that while the cloud provider can play a role in helping ensure your cloud is secure , they ca n’t do it alone .



It ’s your part of the cloud , your data , and you ’re paying for those computing assets .



It ’s your job to make sure they ’re secure .



Microsoft and Google have been bitter rivals for at least a decade , and the pair have had several disagreements over security vulnerability disclosure in recent years .

The public disclosure will likely anger Microsoft , once again .



The software giant hit back at Google ’s approach to security patches last October , after discovering a Chrome flaw and “ responsibly ” disclosed it to Google so the company had enough time to patch .

At the heart of the issue is whether Google ’s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is reasonable .



Google makes exceptions to this hard rule , with grace periods , and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited .

Two big and obvious exceptions to Google ’s security disclosure rules were the recent Meltdown and Spectre bugs .



Google engineers discovered the CPU flaws and Intel , AMD , and others had around six months to fix the problems before the flaws were publicly disclosed earlier this year .

Google wants the industry to adopt its aggressive disclosure policies , but Microsoft has so far resisted rather publicly .



This latest episode is n’t as critical as some of the past disclosures , but it will likely reignite the debate over whether Google , a company with competitive commercial interests , should be leading the way security flaws in rival operating systems are disclosed in the public interest .

Top hospital officials called the Los Angeles Police Department last week , according to police Lt John Jenal .



Laura Eimiller , an FBI spokeswoman , said the bureau has taken over the hacking investigation but declined to discuss specifics of the case .



Law enforcement sources told The Times that the hospital paid the ransom before reaching out to law enforcement for assistance .

A Ukrainian cybercrime operation has made an estimated $ 50 million by using Google AdWords to lure users on Bitcoin phishing sites .

The operation has been temporarily disrupted this month when Ukrainian cyber police shut down servers hosting some of the phishing sites , acting on information they received from Cisco 's Talos security division .



No arrests were made , and it 's very likely that the group will make a comeback in the future .



The group — which Cisco tracked internally under the codename of Coinhoarder — has been operating for years , but appears to have used the same scheme since February 2017 , possibly earlier .



Crooks purchase so - called typosquatted domains that imitate the real Blockchain.info Bitcoin wallet management service .

Coinhoarder operators then set up phishing pages on these domains that log users credentials , which they later use to steal funds from users ' accounts .

According to Cisco , instead of using malvertising or spam campaigns , crooks buy legitimate ads via the Google AdWords platform and place links to their phishing sites at the top of Bitcoin - related Google search results .

This trick is not only simple to execute but very effective .



Cisco reported that based on DNS query data , ads for one domain roped in over 200,000 users .



It is believed the group lured tens of millions of users to its phishing sites .

It is unclear how many users tried to log in on the fake sites , but after tracking down various thefts reported on social media and involving some of the Coinhoarder groups typosquatted domains , Cisco says the group made around $ 50 million worth of Bitcoin in the past three years .



For example , in one campaign that took place from September 2017 to December 2017 , the group made around $ 10 million , while in another campaign that lasted 3.5 weeks , the group made another $ 2 million .



Researchers also point out that crooks used geo - targeting filters for their ads , targeting mostly Bitcoin owners in Africa .



" This threat actor appears to be standing up phishing pages to target potential victims African countries and other developing nations where banking can be more difficult , and local currencies much more unstable compared to the digital asset , " researchers said in a report published yesterday .

" Additionally , attackers have taken notice that targeting users in countries whose first language is not English make for potentially easier targets . "



Cisco says it tracked down the phishing sites hosted on the servers of a bulletproof hosting provider located in Ukraine — Highload Systems .



This is where Ukraine 's cyber police department intervened and took down servers .



According to Cisco , the Coinhoarder group is by far the largest phishing operation that has targeted Blockchain.info , the biggest Bitcoin wallet service online .

Among the new tricks detected by Cisco since our previous reports , crooks have started using Let 's Encrypt certificates to make their phishing sites load via HTTPS , and have also incorporated homograph attacks .



If you 've just paid your self - assessment tax bill , be vigilant if you receive an email informing you that you 're due a refund .



Fraudsters are targeting taxpayers with spurious emails and text messages pretending to be from the government .

I received one such email over the weekend , telling me I was due a refund of £ 222.32 .



The email came complete with a bogus ' HMRC Transaction Confirmation ' number and a link claiming to be to the Government Gateway , which is used to access online government services .

At first glance , it may look fairly convincing - the spelling and grammar is pretty good , it contains plenty of official - looking reference numbers and the web links are at least in part quite similar to the genuine articles .



But it 's very definitely a ' phishing ' email - whereby the fraudster sender is trying to hook you into providing personal information .

In this case , they 're after my credit or debit card numbers .



Phishing happens by text message too .



Earlier this month HMRC reported people are nine times more likely to fall for text message scams than other types such as email because they can appear more legitimate , with many texts displaying ‘ HMRC ’ as the sender , rather than a phone number .



It also said it had ' stopped thousands of taxpayers from receiving scam text messages , with 90 per cent of the most convincing texts now halted before they reach their phones ' .



To help you protect yourself and your bank account , there are several warning signs you should always look out for to determine whether such emails and texts are fakes This is in case they contain malware - software with a virus that can read personal information on your computer – or destroy it .



The bug is often activated by users inadvertently opening an attachment or clicking on an email link .



And it 's not just emails and texts about tax refunds you need to be vigilant towards .



A spokesman for Action Fraud told This is Money : ' At this important time in the tax year when people will be claiming refunds , we are warning of fraudsters who contact victims claiming to be from HMRC to trick them into paying bogus debts and taxes . '

' It is important that people spot the signs of this type of fraud to protect themselves . '



HMRC will never use text messages to inform about a tax rebate or penalty and will never ask for any payment in the form of iTunes vouchers .

Social media scams such as blackmail , identity theft , money laundering and dating scams are expected to gain popularity in SA this year .



This is according to Kovelin Naidoo , chief cyber security officer at FNB , who explains that although social media scams in SA are not yet as prevalent as global counterparts ; the reality is that they do exist .



As social media continues to gain prominence among South African consumers , Naidoo believes platforms like Instagram , Youtube , Facebook and Twitter have also become a platform where fraudsters attempt to catch unsuspecting consumers off guard .



" Given that the popularity of social media is set to remain for the coming years , consumers are encouraged to constantly educate themselves and their loved ones about the latest methods that fraudsters use to get hold of their victims ' personal information , " adds Naidoo .



Naidoo warns consumers to look out for money laundering scams - when scammers trick people through social media platforms by claiming to have large sums of cash that they need to deposit urgently through a foreign bank account and identity theft - when fraudsters steal information and use it illegally by impersonating victims .

" Social media blackmail is another scam to watch out for - never share personal photos or videos on social media that portray you in a compromising position as scammers can use these against you by threatening to send them to close family members or upload them on public platforms .



Another scam to gain traction is a social media phishing scam , where fraudsters pretend to represent the victim 's bank on social media platforms , " advises Naidoo .

Manuel Corregedor , COO of Telspace Systems , says consumers who use social media platforms to meet companions or their life partners should also look out for dating or romance scams .



" In these scams , criminals play on the emotions of victims in order to scam them out of money i.e. they target certain profiles based on age , gender and marital status .



Once connected , the criminal starts to ' build a relationship ' , with the victim as a means to get them to like or love them .



Once this happens , the criminal plays on the victim 's emotions as a means to get money from the client .



" It is necessary to create an awareness around such scams and educate people , advises Corregedor .



However , it should be noted , that these scams are not new - they existed before social media .



Additional things users can do to protect themselves online is to only add people on social media sites , in particular Facebook , that they have met in person before ; restrict who can see your photos , posts , and look out for the following signs that it might be a scam .



Denis Makrushin , security researcher at Kaspersky Lab , says that social media chain letters and phishing is also expected to gain traction this year .
16,17 phishing

" Some social media messages ask recipients to send a small sum of money to certain addressees .



Cyber criminals use chain letters to distribute malware - a letter may contain a link to a malicious Web site .

0,2 person|2,5 capabilities|6,8 purpose|9,11 file|13,15 website|16,20 website

A recipient is lured into visiting the site on some pretext or other , for example they are warned about a virus epidemic and are offered the possibility to download an ' antivirus program ' .

For example , one might be a security alert saying that someone just tried to sign into your account from such and such address using such and such browser - all you have to do is click the link to check that everything 's OK , " he explains .



Naidoo advises social media users to never share their banking details with strangers and to think twice before sending money to someone you recently met online or have n't met in person yet .



Email is great for keeping in touch with friends and family and quickly conversing with colleagues but it ’s not without its pitfalls .



Scammers approach people via email to encourage them to hand over private or sensitive information about themselves or the company they work for .

“ The first thing you should know about phishing is that it almost always involves a form of ‘ social engineering ’ , in which the scammer tries to manipulate you into trusting them for fraudulent purposes , often by pretending to be a legitimate person or business .

Secondly , if an email does n’t seem legitimate , it probably is n’t ; it ’s always better to be safe than sorry . ”



Here are four of the most popular scams circulating today : 1 ) The CEO Scam This scam appears as an email from a leader in your organisation , asking for highly sensitive information like company accounts or employee salaries .
20,22 file|23,25 person|26,28 organization|29,34 purpose|16,18 phishing|18,20 phishing|18,21 tool|18,22 tool|19,21 tool|19,22 tool|18,24 trusted-entity|18,25 trusted-entity|19,24 trusted-entity|19,25 trusted-entity|18,27 trusted-entity|18,28 trusted-entity|19,27 trusted-entity|19,28 trusted-entity|18,30 purpose|18,31 purpose|18,32 purpose|18,33 purpose|18,34 purpose|19,30 purpose|19,31 purpose|19,32 purpose|19,33 purpose|19,34 purpose

The hackers fake the boss ’s email address so it looks like a legitimate internal company email .
0,2 person|6,8 personally-identifiable-information|4,5 person|12,17 file|2,3 phishing|10,12 phishing|0,3 r_attacker|1,3 r_attacker|2,7 trusted-entity|2,8 trusted-entity|2,5 trusted-entity|10,13 trusted-entity|10,14 trusted-entity|10,15 trusted-entity|10,16 trusted-entity|10,17 trusted-entity|11,13 trusted-entity|11,14 trusted-entity|11,15 trusted-entity|11,16 trusted-entity|11,17 trusted-entity

That ’s what makes this scam so convincing – the lure is that you want to do your job and please your boss .



But keep this scam in mind if you receive an email asking for confidential or highly sensitive information , and ask the apparent sender directly whether the request is real , before responding .



2 ) The Lucky Email How fortunate !



You ’ve won a free gift , an exclusive service , or a great deal on a trip abroad .



Just remember , whatever “ limited time offer ” you ’re being sold , it ’s probably a phishing scam designed to get you to give up your credit card number or identity information .
9,10 person|25,34 purpose|17,20 phishing|9,18 r_victim|9,19 r_victim|9,20 r_victim|17,26 purpose|17,27 purpose|17,28 purpose|17,29 purpose|17,30 purpose|17,31 purpose|17,32 purpose|17,33 purpose|17,34 purpose|18,26 purpose|18,27 purpose|18,28 purpose|18,29 purpose|18,30 purpose|18,31 purpose|18,32 purpose|18,33 purpose|18,34 purpose|19,26 purpose|19,27 purpose|19,28 purpose|19,29 purpose|19,30 purpose|19,31 purpose|19,32 purpose|19,33 purpose|19,34 purpose
9,10 person|25,34 purpose|17,20 phishing|9,20 r_victim|17,34 purpose

The lure here is something free or exciting at what appears to be little or no cost to you .



3 ) The Urgent Email Attachment Phishing emails that try to trick you into downloading a dangerous attachment that can potentially infect your computer and steal your private information have been around for a long time .
6,8 file|12,13 person|14,18 capabilities|21,24 purpose|25,29 purpose|11,12 phishing|6,12 r_tool|7,12 r_tool|11,13 victim|11,15 attack-pattern|11,16 attack-pattern|11,17 attack-pattern|11,18 attack-pattern|11,22 purpose|11,23 purpose|11,24 purpose|11,26 purpose|11,27 purpose|11,28 purpose|11,29 purpose

This is because they work .



You ’ve probably received emails asking you to download attachments confirming a package delivery , trip itinerary or prize .



They might urge you to “ respond immediately ” .



The lure here is offering you something you want , and invoking a sense of urgency to get you to click .
5,6 person|0,2 phishing|0,6 victim|1,6 victim
5,6 person|0,2 phishing|0,6 victim

4 ) The Romance Scam This one can happen completely online , over the phone , or in person once initial contact is established .



But the romance scam always starts with someone supposedly looking for love .



The scammer often poses as a friend - of - a-friend via email and contacts you directly .
5,11 person|0,2 person|11,17 capabilities|3,5 phishing|3,6 trusted-entity|3,7 trusted-entity|3,8 trusted-entity|3,9 trusted-entity|3,10 trusted-entity|3,11 trusted-entity|4,6 trusted-entity|4,7 trusted-entity|4,8 trusted-entity|4,9 trusted-entity|4,10 trusted-entity|4,11 trusted-entity|0,4 r_attacker|0,5 r_attacker|1,4 r_attacker|1,5 r_attacker|3,12 attack-pattern|3,13 attack-pattern|3,14 attack-pattern|3,15 attack-pattern|3,16 attack-pattern|3,17 attack-pattern|4,12 attack-pattern|4,13 attack-pattern|4,14 attack-pattern|4,15 attack-pattern|4,16 attack-pattern|4,17 attack-pattern
5,11 person|0,2 person|11,17 capabilities|3,5 phishing|3,11 trusted-entity|0,5 r_attacker|3,17 attack-pattern

But what starts as the promise of love or partnership , often leads to requests for money or pricey gifts .



The scammer will sometimes spin a hardship story , saying they need to borrow money to come visit you or pay their phone bill so they can stay in touch .



The lure here is simple – love and acceptance .



Brookes added : “ It is everyone ’s responsibility to be aware and educate each other – we need to share knowledge and collaborate to protect ourselves against the current threats we face as people living in a connected world . ”



A new form of ransomware has emerged which is , unusually , being distributed by two separate exploit kits -- one of which was thought to have disappeared -- and demands payment in a lesser - known form of cryptocurrency .

First seen on January 26 , GandCrab has been spotted being distributed by two exploit kits , RIG EK and GrandSoft EK .



According to researchers at security company Malwarebytes , it 's unusual in itself for ransomware to be pushed using an exploit kit , with such tactics usually reserved for trojans and coin - miners .



An exploit kit is used by cybercriminals to take advantage of vulnerabilities in systems in order to distribute malware and perform other malicious activities .



In contrast , ransomware is usually delivered by spam email .



The only other form of ransomware known to be consistently distributed with an exploit kit is Magniber .



GandCrab is distributed via the RIG exploit kit , which uses vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash Player to launch JavaScript , Flash , and VBscript - based attacks to distribute malware to users .



It 's possible that RIG spreads GandCrab to victims using malvertising on compromised websites , in an attack method similar to that used by Princess ransomware .



GandCrab is also distributed using GrandSoft , an exploit kit which first appeared in 2012 , but was thought to have disappeared .



The GrandSoft EK takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment which allows attackers to remotely execute code , and in this case is used to distribute GandCrab .



Once the payload has been dropped and run on a compromised system , GandCrab , for the most part , acts like any other form of ransomware , encrypting Windows files using an RSA algorithm and demanding payment for the ' GandCrab Decryptor ' required to unlock the files .

The encrypted files gain a .



GDCB extension , with the encryption loop designed in such a way it will eventually affect every file on the drive .



However , unlike many forms of ransomware , GandCrab does n't demand payment in bitcoin , but rather in a form of cryptocurrency called Dash .

Those behind the ransomware demand 1.5 Dash ( listed on the note as $ 1,200 , although the fluctuating prices mean it 's ever changing ) as a ransom , a price which doubles to three Dash ( $ 2,400 ) if the price is n't paid within a few days .

The demand for payment in Dash represents the latest example of ransomware distributors attempting to move away from bitcoin and onto other cryptocurrency , for reasons ranging from increased privacy and security to other forms of blockchain - based virtual currency being less popular than bitcoin and therefore quicker to process .
3,6 payment-method|18,19 payment-method|21,23 payment-method|0,2 ransom|0,4 payment-method|0,5 payment-method|0,6 payment-method|1,4 payment-method|1,5 payment-method|1,6 payment-method|0,19 payment-method|1,19 payment-method|0,22 payment-method|0,23 payment-method|1,22 payment-method|1,23 payment-method
3,6 payment-method|18,19 payment-method|21,23 payment-method|0,2 ransom|0,6 payment-method|0,19 payment-method|0,23 payment-method

There 's currently no means of decrypting GandCrab ransomware files for free at this time , meaning the best way to avoid falling victim is to ensure all software updates and patches have been applied to ensure the vulnerabilities exploited by the exploit kits ca n't be used to distribute ransomware from infected sites .

Employees knew something was wrong Thursday night , when the network began running more slowly than normal , senior vice president / chief strategy and innovation officer Rob Matt said .



A short time later , a message flashed on a hospital computer screen , stating parts of the system would be held hostage until a ransom is paid .

The hospital ’s IT team opted to immediately shut down the network to isolate the problem .



The attack affected Hancock Health ’s entire health network , including its physician offices and wellness centers .



Friday afternoon , Hancock Health CEO Steve Long confirmed the network was targeted by a ransomware attack from an unnamed hacker who “ attempted to shut down ( Hancock Health ’s ) operations . ”

The attack amounts to a “ digital padlock , ” restricting personnel access to parts of the health network ’s computer systems , he said .



The attack was not the result of an employee opening a malware - infected email , a common tactic used to hack computer systems , he said .



The attack was sophisticated , he said , adding FBI officials are familiar with this method of security breach .



“ This was not a 15 - year - old kid sitting in his mother ’s basement , ” Long said .



Protecting patients Notices posted Friday at entrances to Hancock Regional Hospital alerted visitors to a “ system - wide outage ” and asked any hospital employee or office using a HRH network to ensure all computers were turned off .



Doctors and nurses have reverted to using pen and paper for now to keep patients ’ medical charts updated .



Long said he was n’t aware of any appointments or procedures that were canceled directly related to the incident , adding Friday ’s snowy weather contributed to many cancellations .



Most patients likely did n’t notice there was a problem , nor did the attack significantly impact patient care , Long said .



Hospital staff members worked with the FBI and a national IT security company overnight and throughout the day Friday to resolve the issue .



Long said law enforcement has been acting in an “ advisory capacity , ” and declined to release details about the plan going forward , including whether the hospital is considering paying the ransom .

Long commended his staff , especially IT workers , who quickly identified the problem Thursday evening .



“ If I was going through this with anybody , this is the team I would want to go through this with because I know what the outcome is going to be , ” he said .



Leaders updated hospital employees , totaling about 1,200 people , throughout the day Friday and took steps to be accommodate both patients and staff , including offering free food in the hospital cafeteria all day , Long said .



Long said if there is any suggestion private patient information has been compromised , hospital officials will reach out to those affected , though he does n’t expect that to become an issue .

A Tor proxy service is being used by crooks to divert ransom payments to their own accounts at the expense of ransomware distributors -- and their victims , according to security researchers .

Ransomware distributors expecting an easy payday are having their illicit earnings stolen by other cybercriminals , who are hijacking the ransom payments before they 're received and redirecting them into their own bitcoin wallets .

But not only are the attacks giving criminals a taste of their own medicine in becoming victims of cyber-theft , they are also preventing ransomware victims from unlocking their encrypted files -- because , as far as those distributing the malware are concerned , they never received their ransom payment .

Uncovered by researchers at Proofpoint , it 's believed to be the first scheme of its kind , with cybercriminals using a Tor proxy browser to carry out man - in - the - middle attacks to steal the cryptocurrency payments , which victims of ransomware are attempting to send to their attackers .

While many ransomware notes provide instructions on how to download and run the Tor browser , others provide links to a Tor proxy -- regular websites that translate Tor traffic into normal web traffic -- so the process of paying is as simple as possible for the victim .

However , one of the Tor gateways being used is altering bitcoin wallet addresses in the proxy , and redirecting the payment into other accounts , rather than those of the ransomware attacker .

Meanwhile , those behind Magniber ransomware appear to have moved to combat bitcoin address replacement by splitting the HTML source code of wallets into four parts , thus making it harder for proxies to find the address to change .



While the sums of bitcoin stolen do n't represent a spectacular haul , the interception attacks do create problems for ransomware distributors -- and their victims .



The victims are the ultimate losers in this scenario .



Not only are they paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to in ransom demands , they 're not even getting their files back in return because the man - in - the - middle attacks mean the ransomware distributors do n't think they 've been paid .

In May , a ransomware virus affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries , including more than 20 % of hospitals in the United Kingdom .



That attack was later traced to North Korea .



Hancock Health said it worked with the FBI and hired an Indianapolis cybersecurity expert for advice on how to respond to the attack .

The virus infected a number of the hospital ’s IT system and , according to local reports , the malware targeted over 1,400 files and changed the name of each to “ I ’m sorry . ”



Hancock officials followed its incident response and crisis management plan and contacted legal representation and outside security firm immediately following the discovery of the attack .



Hospital leadership also contacted the FBI for advisory assistance .



The incident was contained by Friday and officials said the next focus was recovery .



Hancock Health was given just seven days to pay the ransom .

The virus did not impact any equipment used to treat patients .



However , the hospital ’s patient portal was down during the security incident .



After recovery , officials asked employees to reset passwords and implemented a security feature that could detect similar attacks in the future .



The breach should serve as a wake - up call that ransomware attacks can happen .

The infection took root last week , on Thursday , January 11 , when attackers breached the network of Hancock Health , a regional hospital in the city of Greenfield , Indiana .



Attackers deployed the SamSam ransomware , which encrypted files and renamed them with the phrase " I ’m sorry " , according to a local newspaper who broke the news last week .



Hospital operations were affected right away .



IT staff intervened and took down the entire network , asking employees to shut down all computers to avoid the ransomware from spreading to other PCs .



By Friday , the next day , the hospital was littered with posters asking employees to shut down any computer until the incident was resolved .



While some news sites reported that the hospital shut down operations , medical and management staff continued their work , but with pen and paper instead of computers .



Patients continued to receive care at the hospital 's premise .



Hospital had backups but decides to pay ransom demand .

The hospital said that despite having backups it opted to pay the ransom demand of 4 Bitcoin , which was worth around $ 55,000 at the time the hospital paid the sum , on Saturday morning .

Hospital management told local press that restoring from backups was not a solution as it would have taken days and maybe even weeks to have all systems up and running .



Hence , they decided paying the ransom was quicker .

By Monday , all systems were up and running , and the hospital released a short statement on its site admitting to the incident , but with very few other details .



While the hospital has not confirmed the typical SamSam attack scenario , they did say the infection was not the case of an employee opening a malware - infected email .



The FBI has long asked companies and individuals affected by ransomware to report any infections via the IC3 portal so the Bureau can get a better grasp of the threat and have the legal reasons to go after such groups .



GREENFIELD — Hancock Health paid a $ 55,000 ransom to hackers to regain access to its computer systems , hospital officials said .

The hackers targeted more than 1,400 files , the names of every one temporarily changed to “ I ’m sorry . ”



They gave the hospital seven days to pay or the files would be permanently encrypted , officials said .

An analysis since the attack confirmed no personal patient information was taken by the hackers , believed to be located in eastern Europe , said Hancock Health CEO Steve Long .

The affected files were backed up and could have been recovered , but restoring them would take days — maybe even weeks — and would be costly , Long said .



From a business standpoint , paying a small ransom made more sense , he said .

At the time of the transfer , those four bitcoins were valued at about $ 55,000 .



It seems the old warning ' you get what you pay for ' can just as easily be applied to items purchased on underground forums and the dark web as it can to anything you buy elsewhere , because unbeknown to those experimenting with free phishing kits , they 're secretly being phished themselves .

An analysis of over one thousand phishing kits designed to allow wannabe cybercriminals to build phishing emails and websites found that , in a significant proportion of cases , the trainee phishers are being compromised , with their stolen data being secretly sent to the kit authors .

With phishing simple to carry out but potentially very financially rewarding -- some of the highest profile cyber-attacks of recent years began with a phishing email -- it 's no wonder that newbie hackers want in .

But their lack of skill is coming back to bite some of these aspiring cybercriminals , who might find that all their ill - gotten gains are also transferred to the original author of the kit .



Researchers at Imperva analysed 1,019 readily - available phishing kits , finding underground markets filled with low - cost and free phishing kits advertised as means of providing aspiring cyber-attackers with a route into the illegal industry .



" Underground markets are full of phishing kits at all levels and cost , some even distributed at no charge , usually revealing one of the oldest rules in the book -- you get what you pay for , " said Luda Lazar , security research engineer at Imperva .



" Here we found the only free cheese is in the mousetrap , " she added .



While these phishing kits did provide aspiring attackers with the files necessary to create a copy of target websites and steal valuable information , many of these free offerings contain an undisclosed backdoor .

That means the kit author is able to secretly track the campaigns of the crooks using the software and gain access to the stolen information themselves .

13,15 person|2,5 person|22,25 data|9,10 databreach|19,21 databreach|9,15 victim|2,10 r_attacker|19,25 compromised-data

In doing so , they 're able exploit the likes of stolen usernames , passwords , and credit card details without putting in the effort required to collect them .

As a result , the phishing kit user ca n't reap much from their criminal gains , as in many cases , victims will change passwords or cancel credit cards if they realise they 've been targeted .



" About 25 percent of the kits contained implicit recipients which receive emails with the phishing results as well as the kit buyers who were intended to receive it .

We assume that the hidden addresses belong to the kits ' authors , which are actually stealing from the inexperienced phishers who deploy these kits , " said Lazar .

Ultimately , by offering these phishing kits for free , it provides those behind them with the largest possible pool of victims to exploit -- and it 's not as if a hacker can complain to the authorities that they 've been scammed .



The White House has publicly blamed North Korea for a ransomware attack in May that locked more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries .

" North Korea has acted especially badly , largely unchecked , for more than a decade , " Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said at a White House briefing Tuesday morning .



He called the WannaCry attack a reckless attack that caused " havoc and destruction " by locking vital information away from users , including hospital networks .

" We believe now we have the evidence to support this assertion , " Bossert said .



" It 's very difficult to do when you 're looking for individual hackers .



In this case , we found a concerted effort .



" In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday , Bossert wrote that after careful investigation , Washington can say that Pyongyang is " directly responsible " for the WannaCry virus .



Bossert called the attack in which victims received ransom demands to unlock their computers " cowardly , costly and careless . "

" The consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic , " he wrote .



" The malicious software hit computers in the U.K. 's health - care sector particularly hard , compromising systems that perform critical work .

These disruptions put lives at risk .



" Bossert is expected to brief reporters on Tuesday about the hacking .



NPR 's Elise Hu tells Morning Edition that " cyberattacks are a way for North Korea to punch above its weight " and that Pyongyang 's hackers " have access to global networks and the Internet , and they have some real successes to count . "



Within days of the attack in May , North Korea fell under suspicion .



As NPR 's Bill Chappell reported at the time , WannaCry was found to have " lines of code that are identical to work by hackers known as the Lazarus Group , [ which has ] ... been linked to North Korea , raising suspicions that the nation could be responsible . "



And in October , Britain 's Minister of State for Security Ben Wallace said his government was " as sure as possible " that Pyongyang launched the attack .



Bossert said in the Journal that President Trump had " ordered the modernization of government information - technology to enhance the security of the systems we run on behalf of the American people . "



" We also indicted Russian hackers and a Canadian acting in concert with them .



A few weeks ago , we charged three Chinese nationals for hacking , theft of trade secrets and identity theft .

There will almost certainly be more indictments to come , " he wrote .



He said that the administration would continue to use its " maximum pressure strategy to curb Pyongyang 's ability to mount attacks , cyber or otherwise . "



Bitcoin - seeking hackers are using old - school tricks to socially engineer would - be cryptocurrency exchange executives , researchers warn .



An attack group tied to North Korea has " launched a malicious spear - phishing campaign using the lure of a job opening for the CFO role at a European - based cryptocurrency company , " researchers at Secureworks Counter Threat Unit warn in a report .

The CTU researchers refer to the group behind the attack as " Nickel Academy , " although it is perhaps better known as the Lazarus Group ( see Kaspersky Links North Korean IP Address to Lazarus ) .



The group has been tied to numerous attacks , including the attempted theft of nearly $ 1 billion from the central bank of Bangladesh 's New York Federal Reserve account , leading to $ 81 million being stolen ; the WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May ; as well as the use of cryptocurrency mining malware named Adylkuzz to attack the same flaw in Windows server block messaging that WannaCry also targeted ( see Cybercriminals Go Cryptocurrency Crazy : 9 Factors ) .

The malicious code has " solid technical linkages " to attacks previously attributed to Lazarus , CTU says ( see Report : North Korea Seeks Bitcoins to Bypass Sanctions ) .



Researchers at Israeli cybersecurity startup Intezer also believe the code has been reused by Lazarus , based on a review of attack code that 's been seen in the wild since 2014 .



The fake job advertisement pretends to be for Luno , a bitcoin wallet software and cryptocurrency exchange based in London , according to an analysis of the phishing messages published Tuesday by Jay Rosenberg , a senior security researcher at Intezer .

The CTU researchers say this is an attempt to enable macros in Word , so that a malicious macro hidden inside the document can execute .



If it does , the macro creates a decoy document - the fake CFO job lure - as well as installs a first - stage remote access Trojan RAT in the background .



Once the RAT is running on the victim 's PC , attackers can use it to install additional malware onto the system , such as keystroke loggers and password stealers ( see Hello !



Can You Please Enable Macros ? )



.



The CTU researchers say the job listing appears to have been stolen from a legitimate CFO job listing posted to LinkedIn by a cryptocurrency firm in Asia .

While the researchers say that Lazarus has done this previously , unusually in this case , some typographical errors in the original listing were expunged .



The researchers add that this phishing campaign does not appear to target any specific firm or individual , but rather to be more broadly aimed .

" There are common elements in the macro and in the first - stage RAT used in this campaign with former campaigns , " the researchers write .



The custom command - and - control network code that controls infected endpoints also includes components that were seen in previous attacks tied to Lazarus , they add .



Ransomware authors are profiting from the rise of the cryptocurrency -- but it 's also bringing some unexpected problems for them and other dark web operators .



The value of bitcoin has soared in recent days : at the one point the cryptocurrency was worth almost $ 19,000 before it dropped back to around $ 16,500 , where it has roughly remained since .



It 's almost impossible to predict what will happen next .



The price of bitcoin could rise again or it could crash -- but , for now at least , a single unit of the cryptocurrency is worth a significant amount of money .



Bitcoin has become the popular payment method for ransomware over the last two years , as the digital currency provides cybercriminals with a means of collecting ransoms , while also making it difficult to get the ransom - collectors ' identities , thanks to the level of anonymity it offers .

WannaCry , the biggest ransomware event of the year , for example , hit hundreds of thousands of PCs around the globe , encrypting files and demanding a payment of $ 300 in bitcoin for the safe return of what was stored on the machine .

However , by the time those behind WannaCry had withdrawn funds from the associated Bitcoin wallets -- a full three months after the attack -- it meant the 338 payments victims had made were worth around $ 140,000 , which was an increase in value of just under $ 50,000 compared to when the majority of payments were made .

But the sudden spike in bitcoin could actually be problematic for some cybercriminals .



Before the surge in value , 1 or 0.5 bitcoin was a common ransom demand , with the idea that if the fee was low enough -- back then the ransom value worked out at a few hundred dollars -- this would encourage the victim to pay up .

Even as the value of bitcoin steadily rose during the summer , some attackers were still using the standard amounts of cryptocurrency as their ransom demand .

Two months later , 0.2 bitcoin is currently worth $ 3,312 while 0.4 bitcoin is up to $ 6,625 .



Many forms of ransomware already ask for the payment of a specified amount of dollars to be made in bitcoin .

While it pins hopes on victims being able to buy a specific amount of bitcoin and successfully transfer the payment -- which some criminal gangs get around by manning help desks providing advice on buying cryptocurrency -- it 's more likely to result in the victim paying up , especially if the figure is just a few hundred dollars .

" I imagine the volatility of bitcoin pricing has been an unexpected problem for cybercriminals .



The average ransom demand has remained somewhere between $ 300 to $ 1000 , and normally the ransom note will specify a USD amount , " Andy Norton , director of threat intelligence at Lastline , told ZDNet .

It is n't just ransomware distributors who might be faced with the problem of valuing items in pure bitcoin : a Dark Web vendor -- whether they are selling malware , weapons , drugs , or any other illegal item -- might find that setting their price in pure bitcoin will quickly result in them pricing themselves out of the market .



With bitcoin prices continuing to rise , sophisticated cybercriminal operators can likely react to it , altering prices on a day - to - day basis to ensure that they 're able to sustain their business .



Criminals are trying out alternative pricing models for ransomware already .



Some criminals already operate around the idea that they charge victims just enough so that they do n't see the ransom as too much to pay -- and that often depends on the country the victims are in .

“ The best advice for now is to limit your use of emails containing attachments , and try to conduct as much business as possible by phone or in person . ”



She described the aftermath of the ransomware attack as a “ crisis ” and reassured employees they should not feel personally responsible for the incident .

Forty - eight of about 500 county computer servers were affected .



Officials in Mecklenburg , N.C. must make a difficult decision by 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday : They must choose whether to pay two bitcoins — currently worth about $ 25,000 — to hackers who are holding the county ’s computer files for ransom , [ Update : they refused to pay ] .

Typically , the code can only be obtained by paying the hackers .
10,12 person|9,10 ransom|9,11 attacker|9,12 attacker

An official for the county , which encompasses the city of Charlotte , said the ransomware was triggered when an employee clicked on an email attachment , and that it is wrecking havoc with daily operations : “ She said an example of the problem is the county ’s code enforcement office , where much of the work is done electronically .



Employees no longer have access to their records .



But she said they are switching to paper records for work on Wednesday , ” according to the Charlotte Observer .



The official also explained that the county faces a dilemma in deciding whether to pay .

The anonymous hackers do not appear to have targeted Mecklenburg county in particular , but rather the official thinks the attack was launched as part of a broader money - making scheme involving ransomware .



Similar attacks , which typically exploit old Microsoft software , struck millions of computers in two separate waves earlier this year , affecting everything from businesses to governments to hospitals .



While most of the incidents occurred in Europe and Asia , U.S. organizations were hit too — including a transit system in Sacramento , Calif. and a hospital in Los Angeles .



A flaw in certificate pinning exposed customers of a number of high - profile banks to man - in - the - middle attacks on both iOS and Android devices .



A vulnerability in the mobile apps of major banks could have allowed attackers to steal customers ' credentials including usernames , passwords , and pin codes , according to researchers .

0,2 vulnerability|4,8 system|2,4 discover-vulnerability|0,4 r_vulnerability|2,8 vulnerable-system

While certificate pinning usually improves security , a tool developed by the researchers to perform semi-automated security - testing of mobile apps found that a flaw in the technology meant standard tests failed to detect attackers trying to take control of a victim 's online banking .



As a result , certificate pinning can hide the lack of proper hostname verification , enabling man - in - the - middle attacks .



The findings have been outlined in a research paper and presented at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference in Orlando , Florida .

That could allow them to view information entered and perform any operation that app can usually perform -- such as making payments or transferring of funds .



Other attacks allowed hackers to perform in - app phishing attacks against Santander and Allied Irish bank users , allowing attackers to take over part of the screen while the app was running and steal the entered credentials .

A University of Birmingham spokesperson told ZDNet all the banks were highly cooperative : " once this was flagged to them they did work with the team to amend it swiftly . "



Hacker group “ Charming Kitten ” used false identities to ferret out information , says Israel - based cybersecurity firm ClearSky An Iranian cyber espionage group known as Charming Kitten is believed to be behind a campaign targeting academic researchers , human rights activists , media outlets and political advisors focusing on Iran , according to a report published earlier this week by Israel - based threat intelligence company ClearSky Cyber Security .



The group has also set up a news outlet called The British News Agency to lure targets in .

The attack campaign involves crypto - locking Locky ransomware .



" Beware .



Do n't fall for this .



Locky is horrid , " says Alan Woodward , a computer science professor at the University of Surrey .



The campaign began Monday , according to cloud - based cybersecurity provider AppRiver , which counted more than 23 million related spam emails having been sent in less than 24 hours .
29,31 time|21,23 file|3,4 time|23,26 phishing|23,30 time|23,31 time|24,30 time|24,31 time|25,30 time|25,31 time|21,24 r_tool|21,25 r_tool|21,26 r_tool|22,24 r_tool|22,25 r_tool|22,26 r_tool|3,24 r_time|3,25 r_time|3,26 r_time
29,31 time|21,23 file|3,4 time|23,26 phishing|23,31 time|21,26 r_tool|3,26 r_time

That makes it " one of the largest malware campaigns that we have seen in the latter half of 2017 , " says Troy Gill , manager of security research for AppRiver , in a blog post .



Finnish security firm F - Secure says that the majority of the spam messages that its systems are currently blocking relate to Locky .



It notes that some spam contains links to infected sites , while other messages carry malicious attachments .



If a system becomes infected with this strain of Locky , crypto - locked files will have the extension " .



lukitus " added , which is a Finnish word variously translated by native speakers as " locking " or " locked , " according to F - Secure .



The Lukitus variant of Locky was first spotted last month .



Rommel Joven , a malware researcher with security firm Fortinet , warned that it was being distributed via email attachments as part of a massive spam campaign being run by the one of the world 's biggest botnets , Necurs , which has historically been the principle outlet for Locky attacks .



Spam Can Carry Locky Attachments AppRiver says emails related to the new Locky campaign have featured a variety of subject lines , including these words : documents , images , photo , pictures , please print , scans .



" Each message comes with a zip attachment that contains a Visual Basic Script ( VBS ) file that is nested inside a secondary zip file , " Gill says .



" Once clicked , [ the ] VBS file initiates a downloader that reaches out to greatesthits [ dot ] mygoldmusic [ dotcom ] to pull down the latest Locky ransomware .



Locky goes to work encrypting all the files on the target system and appending [ . ]



lukitus to the users now - encrypted files .



" The ransomware then drops a ransom note on the victim 's desktop . "

" As of Friday , meanwhile , Xavier Mertens , a freelance security consultant and SANS Institute Internet Storm Center contributor based in Belgium , says he 's seeing a new wave of malicious spam that uses emails that pretend to carry voice messages .

Kruse says the attacks are being launched by the group tied to the Affid = 3 [ aka affiliate ID = 3 ] version of Locky .



If victims click on the link , they 're redirected to one of a number of websites .



Clicking on a link can result in a zipped attack file being downloaded , per the VBS attack detailed above , according to security researcher JamesWT , a former member of the anti-malware research group called Malware Hunter Team .



Alternately , clicking on the link may result in the site attempting to execute a malicious JavaScript file that functions as a dropper , meaning it then attempts to download a payload file .



In some attacks , this payload file is Locky .



But JamesWT tells ISMG that malware from the campaign that he uploaded to malware - checking service VirusTotal was identified as being Shade ransomware .



Employees of US NGOs Fight for the Future and Free Press were targeted with complex spear - phishing attempts between July 7 and August 8 , reported today the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .

Based on currently available evidence , the attacks appear to have been orchestrated by the same attacker , located in a UTC +3 - 5:30 timezone , said EFF Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin and EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin .



At least one victim fell for the attacks " Although this phishing campaign does not appear to have been carried out by a nation - state actor and does not involve malware , it serves as an important reminder that civil society is under attack , " said the two today .

" The attackers were remarkably persistent , switching up their attacks after each failed attempt and becoming increasingly creative with their targeting over time , " EFF said .



The most creative of the spear - phishing emails was when victims received emails with the subject line " You have been successfully subscribed to Pornhub.com , " or " You have been successfully subscribed to Redtube.com , " two very popular adult video portals .

These second emails contained explicit subject lines .



Because spear - phishing emails were aimed at work emails , most victims would have been inclined to unsubscribe from the incoming emails .

Saudi Arabian security officials said on Monday that the country had been targeted as part of a wide - ranging cyber espionage campaign observed since February against five Middle East nations as well as several countries outside the region .



The Saudi government ’s National Cyber Security Center ( NCSC ) said in a statement the kingdom had been hit by a hacking campaign bearing the technical hallmarks of an attack group dubbed “ MuddyWater ” by U.S. cyber firm Palo Alto Networks .



Palo Alto ’s Unit 42 threat research unit published a report last Friday showing how a string of connected attacks this year used decoy documents with official - looking government logos to lure unsuspecting users from targeted organizations to download infected documents and compromise their computer networks .

The technical indicators supplied by Unit 42 are the same as those described by the NCSC as being involved in attacks against Saudi Arabia .



The NCSC said the attacks appeared to be by an “ advanced persistent threat ” ( APT ) group - cyber jargon typically used to describe state - backed espionage .



Saudi Arabia has been the target of frequent cyber attacks , including the “ Shamoon ” virus , which cripples computers by wiping their disks and has hit both government ministries and petrochemical firms .



Saudi Aramco , the world ’s largest oil company , was hit by an early version of the “ Shamoon ” virus in 2012 , in the country ’s worst cyber attack to date .



The NCSC declined further comment on the source of the attack or on which organizations or agencies were targeted .



Unit 42 said it was unable to identify the attack group or its aims and did not have enough data to conclude that the MuddyWater group was behind the Saudi attacks as outlined by NCSC .



“ We can not confirm that the NCSC posting and our MuddyWater research are in fact related , ” Christopher Budd , a Unit 42 manager told Reuters .



“ There ’s just not enough information to make that connection with an appropriate level of certainty . ”



Palo Alto Networks said the files it had uncovered were almost identical to information - stealing documents disguised as Microsoft Word files and found to be targeting the Saudi government by security firm MalwareBytes in a September report .

But , it ’s a con and all the senders are really after is your bank details .



What does the email say ?



So far all the emails have been the same .



They say : “ This is an official notification from TV Licensing !



“ We would like to notify you that , after the last annual calculation we have determined that you are eligible to receive a TV Licensing refund of 85.07 GBP .



“ Due to invalid account details records , we were unable to credit your account .



Please fill in the TV Licensing refund request and allow us 5 - 6 working days to the amount to be credited to your account . ”



All this is untrue .



If you receive this email the best thing to do is report it to Action Fraud and then delete it .



Do not click on any links within the email .



“ A small number of our customers have received scam email messages saying they are due a refund , ” a spokesperson for TV Licensing has said .

“ If you receive a similar email message please delete it .



If you have already clicked the link , do not enter or submit any information .



TV Licensing never sends refund information by email and is investigating the source of the fraud . ”



While these emails are a scam they carry an element of truth – you might be due a refund from TV Licensing .



There are a number of ways you can avoid paying the full licence fee .



If you are a student you are entitled to a £ 37 discount on the £ 147.50 colour TV licence .



You can also apply for a refund if you ’ve paid for a TV Licence beyond your 75th birthday .



Anyone over the age of 75 is entitled to watch TV for free .



TV Licences apply to households not individuals so if anyone if your household is a student , or over 75 then you all get the benefit of their discount .



Similarly , if someone in your house is severely visually impaired they are entitled to a half - price TV licence .



You can apply for a refund via the official TV Licensing Website .



A wave of cyberattacks is targeting organisations ' financial departments with a social engineering and phishing campaign designed to trick victims into downloading credential - stealing malware and other threats .

Detailed by researchers at Barracuda Networks , the invoice impersonation attacks aim to persuade the victim that the messages are from trusted sources , or to act on impulse -- planting the idea that the target has lost money is a common tactic in phishing emails , as it creates panic for the user .

The victim thinks they are reacting to an important request when all they 're doing is playing right into the hands of the attackers .



A new wave of these attacks involves attackers sending status updates for invoices -- but these do n't just involve threat actors firing off millions of messages at random and hoping for the best ; they 're specially crafting the attacks to look authentic and crucially , from someone the target might trust .

In one example of this attack , the target receives an email asking for a reply to a query about the payment status of an invoice .

A legitimate - looking invoice number is provided in the subject line and the sender 's name is chosen to be someone the recipient knows .

Mimicking someone the victim knows suggests the attackers are already familiar with the target and their network -- this information could simply have been scraped from a public profile such as LinkedIn or it could indicate that the attackers already have a foothold in the network which they 're looking to exploit for further gains .

The message might look legitimate at first glance -- especially for someone quickly scanning emails in a high - paced financial environment -- but the invitation to click on a link to respond to the supposed status should be treated with suspicion .



But if a recipient does click through , the link will download a Word document supposedly containing the invoice -- which then goes onto install malware onto the system .



It could be subtle , like a trojan or the victim could recognise their error immediately if faced with ransomware .



The attackers are n't just using a single template in the campaign , researchers have spotted other lures used in an effort to distribute a malicious payload .



A second invoice impersonation attack uses the subject ' My current address update ' and claims to contain information from a trusted contact about a change of address , along with details of a new invoice .

The attacks might seem simple , but those behind them would n't be deploying them if they did n't work .



" Impersonation is a proven tactic that criminals are regularly using to attract victims into believing that they are acting on an important message , when that could n't be further from the truth , " said Lior Gavish , VP at Barracuda Networks .

We 've now been able to , at least minimally , conduct business , although the manual system of paper and pencil seems to work pretty well against those kinds of things .



" Lay added that the " appropriate government authorities " have been contacted about the incident , which will meet later this week to discuss an investigation into the incident .



He said it was not a " hack " per se , but a virus created from a downloadable email attachment , locking the system using an encryption key .



" We 're working through it .
