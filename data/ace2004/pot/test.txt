Coal , water , oil , etc . , are normally used for traditional electricity generation .



However , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc .



According to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade .



This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity .



Because of the efficiency of this construction method , the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price .



At the same time , using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions .
