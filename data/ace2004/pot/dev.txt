The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum , and has realized trade surpluses for the third year in a row , whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed , and this year , a relatively large deficit may appear .



According to official journals published recently by Mexico ' s Treasury Department , in 1997 , foreign trade continues to grow at high speed , the total amount of imports and exports reached 220 . 178 billion US dollars , 18 . 85 % higher than that of the previous year , among which the amount of exports is 110 . 38 billion US dollars , imports were 109 . 798 billion US dollars , being 15 % and 22 . 7 % higher than that of 1996 respectively .

In 1995 , the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed , and up to now , has maintained trade surpluses for three years in a row .



However , in the past three years , Mexico ' s foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : 7 . 889 billion US dollars in 1995 , 6 . 424 billion US dollars in 1996 , and only 582 million US dollars last year .

Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in July last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20 million US dollars in July to 722 million US dollars in December , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .

Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of last year was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which is even higher than that of exports .

In the second half of last year , the average growth rate of imports was 6 % to 7 % higher than that of exports .



Among import sectors , swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods , 39 . 9 % and 38 . 2 % higher than that of 1996 respectively .
11,12 PER
11,12 PER

The growth of imports of semi - finished products was up by 18 . 8 % .



Secondly , the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor .



An overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports , but hindered exports .



It is commonly known that in 1994 , before the outbreak of the financial crisis , the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18 billion US dollars .
28,29 GPE

The huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that triggered this crisis .



Hence , the trade situation last year has caused extreme concern among people from economic circles , who even predicted that in 1998 , foreign trade deficit would revive .

A new and simple blood test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life - threatening complications .

Researcher Andrew Levi says scientists have long being puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop complications and why .
0,1 PER|0,3 PER|4,5 PER|13,15 PER
0,1 PER|0,3 PER|4,5 PER|13,15 PER

We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of things .
0,1 PER
0,1 PER

One is how long you ' ve had the diabetes , how well you ' ve been controlled , but it ' s clear that people with the same level of control of their glucose , same duration of the diabetes differ dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are so devastating .

0,1 PER|0,3 PER|4,10 PER|7,10 PER|16,18 PER

Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .
0,1 PER|14,18 PER|15,16 PER
0,1 PER|14,18 PER|15,16 PER

The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die .



Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at Israel ' s Technion Institute have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not .

However , for example , in France the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court , which is a separate body , but yes there also the members are appointed by the President and therefore there also , the members of the Coseque constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law .

However , I think that the image that we Europeans had , of the American system and especially of the US Supreme Court , was that those justices were above politics and , I think , that is also one of the bad surprises that this election is reserving to us Europeans is that finally your system is not as perfect as we were led to believe .

Yes indeed , it was a political idea put forward in the writings of the and another very famous french political observer Alexis de Tocqueville who visited America and wrote an amazingly good book about American democracy , said exactly that , that America seemed to him to be the single country in the world who has managed to apply the separation of powers between the judiciary , the executive , and the legislative in a better way than any other country .
