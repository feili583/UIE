The measurement system , called the visibility index , is intended to provide information beyond the tracking of traffic to a site by tracking the exposure to sites through search engines , keyword inquiries , listings , links from other sites and category listings in online directories .

TORONTO _ Unwilling to fight a counterbid that so far is only speculation , C . I .

Although C . I . Fund ' s cash - and - stock offer , made six weeks ago , was almost 40 percent higher than the price of Mackenzie shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange , Mackenzie management quickly branded the offer ` ` opportunistic ' ' and activated a poison pill , a strategy that makes a hostile bid prohibitively expensive , to give it more time to find other buyers .

The sharp falloff in economic growth in the summer and mounting evidence of more recent weakness , including disappointing Christmas sales , have increased worries about whether America ' s record 10 - year economic expansion was in danger of toppling into a recession .

The neurons produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps relay signals between them .



Dopamine replacement with drugs is the main therapy but it loses effectiveness as the disease progresses .



The next step is transplanting nerve tissue from a fetus to replace the lost dopamine neurons .



But that is a costly , risky surgery .



Now a US - Swiss - French group has successfully tested a third approach in monkeys , one that delivers the seeds of a dopamine neuron nourishment protein directly to the brain by injection .

Previous studies have shown that GDNF keeps dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting it to the brain .



As a defense , the brain ' s blood vessels prevent most compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to design a Parkinson ' s drug .



To overcome this , Mr . Codover ' s team injected a gene to make GDNF right into the monkey ' s brains .

The injection prompted the animals ' immune systems to kick in and clean up the Amyloid deposits in the rodents ' brains .



But those mice never had any difficulties with learning and memory .



In Dr . Westaway ' s view , this made the vaccine sort of pointless , since learning and memory problems are a hallmark of Alzheimer ' s disease .

And the fact that these papers are now showing us that behaviorally these models do what humans do , that is they behave more poorly as they age if they have Alzheimer ' s genes , and that these treatments can reverse that , it just means we have that much more confidence these treatments will work in humans .
