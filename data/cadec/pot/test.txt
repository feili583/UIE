I went to my new physician and he wanted me to try Pravachol .



Afer 4 days on it , I was in a fog and thought I had the flu .



I have been off it for just 36 hours and feel better .



I am an RN and should have known that I was experiencing side effects with Lipitor , but you listen to your Doctor because you trust him .



I now tell my patients to trust what their bodies are telling them .



Statins can ' t be good for anyone but the drug companies ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !



They keep lowering the recommended levels so that almost everyone is considered to have high cholesterol .



If someone is 30 and on this for 30 or 40 years there is not telling what the long term effects will be .

DO NOT USE .

I have a family history of instability or eccentricity .



I have recurrent stomach problems and this drug upset my existing problems and was the catalyst for an all out break down .



The doc .



put me on seroquel after I was diagnosed bi - polar , SO much worse than being crazy .



I ' ve been off both medications and have returned to normal .



This drug was casually prescribed as a pain reliever , it had serious side efeects and would not use it if there is ANY alternative .

Cholesterol went up almost immediately after stopping Lipitor and I felt great again and was able to run again .



A year later I tried Lipitor again with the same side effects as before .



I stopped taking it and decided to live with high cholesterol as taking this drug made my life not worth living .



Possibly diarrhea and stomach pain , but most likely none because I am taking this with a nasty antibiotic for a sinus infection that definitely causes diarrhea and nausea .

I completed the 7 days and then did not take it on the 8 th day .



The pain was immediately worse than before taking Voltaren .



It does help the pain in my knee , which is a strained meniscus , but I ' m afraid that the drug is masking the pain which enables me to overexert my joints and cause more injury .



This really makes me nervous .



I am going to speak with my doctor about this possibility .



I had no side effects the first two days .

I can say that is total rubbish .



I would avoid this medication at all costs .



took celebrex 8 - 1 / 2 years .



when it stopped working my primary physician put me on arthrotec 75 twice a day .



less convenient than the celebrex as twice per day instead of once per day .



otherwise as reported by other comments there is occassional joint pain from increased physical activity .



I was prescribed Zipsor for bone and joint pain associated with Lupus .



I also have 3 herniated discs that have been bothering me for years , and for which I have always taken a low dose of Vicodin ( almost daily ) .



The Zipsor works well on the Lupus pain , but also almost completely wiped out the pain from the herniated discs , and has replaced my usual narcotic pain relief for my back .



As with any disc issues there seems to be the occasional flare up , but when they do occur now they are minor , and once I take my usual dose of Zipsor , the pain is gone again .



I have had no recognizable side effects .



First - WOW !



Second - okay I just started taking Lipitor yesterday - one dose in .



20 mg dose and will try for two months , if something happens sooner I ' ll stop before the two months are up .



What I am reading is that most doctors are NOT prescribing conservative dosages - maybe take that back to them the next appointment ?



Eh ?



My first night - the soundest sleep in over four years !



without pain killers for the constant trigeminal neuralgis ( a side benefit to be sure ) .



Not happy about the idea of statins - strange psychic events when my mother was taking them ( Zocor ) - too strange to repeat in a public forum .



So I am here looking for information about the side effects - anecdotally presented - as the web site for Lipitor does not have the information that would typically come on the drug sheet .



If anyone knows of a site that has the real skinny on Lipitor ' s effects - please pass it along .



Much appreciated ! .



I have not clinically proved my theory yet , but I strongly believe that taking Lipitor for 4 years ended up giving me Multiple Sclerosis .

My cholesterol was it ' s highest at 212 when my GP prescribed the drug .



My total cholesterol while on it got down to 130 ish .



This is too low in my opinion and my body began attacking my CNS and now have to live with this .



Again , this has not yet proven , nor have i gone down that road yet .



Big Pharma wants to promote the use of statins to treat MS , when I stopped taking mine ( Jan 2010 ) that is when my symptoms became present ? ?



I may have been the human rat in that theory .



To make matters even worse , the therapy my neurologist wants to put me on , just so happens to be the same company that mfg . ' s Lipitor .

I was on Lipitor about 2 years when this started .



It went to all of my feet .



My dr wanted to keep me on lipitor but when I quit taking I got better gradually .



I really had to fight my dr to get him to believe that lipitor was causing this .



He put me on another statin after a month of not taking Lipitor and the same thing started to happen .



I am now taking herbs for my cholesterol and it is still high but going lower and my feet are doing better .



Drug co should inform doctors of these problems so they will understand them when their patients come to them for help and .



I found that all statins cause this problem and the drug companies should help rather than hide the problems .

I took 10 mg / day of Lipitor for 6 years .



It worked perfectly and made my blood test numbers for cholesterol , HDL / LDL and Triglycerides look textbook perfect .



A few of the symptoms I listed ( mostly muscular ) quickly appeared when I began the Lipitor and became slowly more intense and more of them came into the picture as each year passed .



I stopped the Lipitor recently out of desperation and most all symptoms improved greatly within days of stopping .



I do not plan to resume it and will find some other way to control things .

I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped .



My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled .



So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem .



I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor , unfortunately .



Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office .



So I did and the next day , after taking only one pill , I was eighty years old again .

This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage .



My doctor , when I told him of all this , wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol .



I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia , which he said was was less effective but was not a statin , which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor .



He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said , well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect , but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed .



I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up !
