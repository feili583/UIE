Russia hints " peace camp " alliance with Germany and France is dying by Dmitry Zaks



MOSCOW , April 13 ( AFP )



Russian President Vladimir Putin 's summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long - term " peace camp " alliance following the end of war in Iraq , government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend .

" The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an argument with the United States . "



The comments indicate that Russia 's nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials .

Russia 's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top Washington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eight billion dollars in Soviet - era debt that Baghdad owes it , as a gesture of good will .

Kommersant business daily joined in , declaring in a furious front - page headline : " The United States is demanding that Russia , France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war . "



And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed : " We should have expected this ! ..



This is only the start of a massive US campaign ( to decide Iraq 's future finances ) . "



Yet Putin has been far more reserved .



He and his loyal finance minister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiver some of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia - US relations .



" On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate , " Putin said .



" Russia has no objections to such a proposal . "



Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post - war revival of Iraq .

But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on Iraq .



And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti - Washington stance of Schroeder and Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush .



Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Bush 's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq , to attend the pow - wow in Saint Petersburg 's Grand Hotel Europe , although diplomats said Blair turned the offer down .

It remains to be seen how successful Putin 's overtures to Washington will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war stance .



A senior lawmaker seen as close to the Kremlin ridiculed the United States Sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .



" We do not think that America won , " said Dmitry Rogozin , the head of the lower house of parliament 's foreign affairs committee , told Rossia television .

Russia misplayed Iraq hand , but damage to US relations not fatal : analysts by Dmitry Zaks

Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin - run forum that countries like China and India that said little about the conflict before its March 20 launch were already reaping the benefits .



Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now be scrambling to contain the damage to his once - budding friendship with US President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by his intelligence and defense aides .

" We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position in Iraq cheaply and we did not .



We should continue sticking to our principles .



"



Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia 's help " to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate . "



Most analysts linked Russia 's opposition to a war in Iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now - toppled regime of Saddam Hussein .



The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world markets and hurt Russia 's budget revenues -- which are heavily reliant on revenues from its own energy exports .



But few at the Kremlin forum suggested that Putin 's own standing among voters will be hurt by Russia 's apparent diplomacy failures .



Putin will face re - election in March 2004 and analysts noted that the war -- while opposed by most Russians -- was never turned by the Kremlin into a matter of national security .



" I do not think that this will affect the elections unless Russia 's failure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security -- and has not been yet , " said Viktor Kuvaldin of a research center funded by former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev .

Anwar , 56 , who this week completed four years in prison on a corruption charge , now faces an earliest possible release date of April 14 , 2009 if he is given one third remission of his sentence for good behaviour .



The former heir - apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad , who says he was framed for political reasons , told reporters after his appeal was rejected : " You must remember its pre - selected judges , most junior of the court of appeal , and its all scripted .



" What do you expect ? "



Mahathir 's sacking of the charismatic and popular Anwar in September 1998 rocked Malaysian politics , with thousands of people taking to the streets to demonstrate their support for him .



Within weeks he was arrested and charged with sodomising an official driver several years previously and with abusing his powers to cover up the offence .



The conduct of the trials was widely criticised internationally and the United States still lists Anwar as a political prisoner .



Anwar was told Monday that he had been granted a standard one - third remission of a six - year corruption sentence for good behaviour , and immediately began to serve the nine - year sentence for sodomy .

NKorea offers to scrap nuke , missile programs but wants big concessions : US



by Matthew Lee



ATTENTION - UPDATES ///



WASHINGTON , April 28 ( AFP ) - North Korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs , but only in return for " considerable " diplomatic , political and economic concessions , the United States said Monday .



Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three - way talks between US , North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing .

At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons , and threatened to prove it with a " display . "



" The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and , in effect , said that these are now up for further discussion , " he told reporters at the State Department .



" They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities , but they , of course , expect something considerable in return , " Powell said .



" We are studying that plan , we are examining it with our friends and allies , " Powell said , adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean , Japanese , Russian and Australian as well as other governments .



" It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here , " he said , referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing .



Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer , and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions .



However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands .

The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States , security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations .



" They had quite a list of things , " State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters .

Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance , Boucher replied : " I do n't really quibble with that characterization of the list . "



A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a " concise description .
2,5 ORG-AFF.Employment|3,5 ORG-AFF.Employment
2,5 ORG-AFF.Employment

"



" It basically listed everything they have ever asked for , " the official told reporters on condition of anonymity , identifying oil and energy supplies as demands .



Although the North Korean demands are being looked at , Boucher repeated long - standing US policy that Washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off .



" We 've made clear we 're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place , " he said .



Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks , but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words " test " or " testing . "



" They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another , " he said .



The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a " bold " proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing , officials said .



South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six - month - old nuclear crisis .
0,3 GEN-AFF.Org-Location|1,3 GEN-AFF.Org-Location
0,3 GEN-AFF.Org-Location

Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides , stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the " verifiable and irreversible termination " of the north 's nuclear programs .



" We ( have ) made clear that once North Korea did that , we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to US - North Korea relations that we had talked about before , " he said .



South Korea 's Munhwa Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed South Korean government sources as saying Pyongyang also urged Washington not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with Seoul and Tokyo .

It insisted North Korea could do " everything " to defend itself if the United States " legally guarantees no use of arms including nukes " .

Australia 's first listed bordello plans sex Disneyland



SYDNEY , April 30 ( AFP )

Chief executive Andrew Harris said the company was likely to abandon plans to acquire a hotel in Sydney 's Kings Cross red light district and acquire another property three times the size in a better location .

The Daily Planet raised 3.5 million dollars ( 2.2 million US ) in its initial public offering with one of the new 600 shareholders acquiring 1.0 million dollars worth of shares .



Renowned Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has been flown to Melbourne as guest of honour at Thursday 's market debut and , according to Harris , has already played a key role in attracting worldwide media attention to the event .

" Heidi 's ideas , her background , her knowledge have helped us a great deal , " he said .



" The international novelty value with Heidi promoting it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere . "



But it has n't been an easy road to the Australian Stock Exchange since the idea was first mooted in 1994 .



" The establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange , " Harris said .



" It 's only because we were the biggest and the best that we could afford to do it .



" We have fought every institution , every law firm ... it 's cost us a fortune but now we 're going on a massive expansion . "



Harris said Sydney was a more attractive option for the sex Disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than Melbourne 's .



" Prostitution is completely decriminalised in Sydney and we are going to build a monster , " he said .



" We want a complete one - stop adult venue -- we want a complete adult venue with adult cinemas , adult shops ... we have found much bigger premises in a much better location to create a sex Disneyland . "

EasyCinema , which aims to sell tickets to its no - frills cinemas for as little as 20 pence ( 0.28 euros , 0.32 dollars ) , has been locked in a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for titles .



Rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors , easyCinema wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first - run movies over a fixed period , a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors .



EasyCinema founder Stelios Haji - Ioannou , who set up easyJet in 1995 and built it up into Europe 's biggest budget airline , has vowed to take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow him access .

Haji - Ioannou professed himself " delighted " , but promised to push ahead in his battle with other distributors .

To cut costs , all booking is done via the Internet and the pared - down cinemas have no popcorn stalls and skeleton staff .

MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud : report



WASHINGTON , May 19 ( AFP )



MCI , formerly WorldCom , and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant 's 11-billion - dollar ( 9.4-billion - euro ) fraud case , The Wall Street Journal reported Monday .



Under terms of the agreement , to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case , MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker - dealer , the Journal said , citing sources close to the matter .



The report did not give the amount of the fine , but said it would be " exponentially larger " than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox paid the SEC last year .



Last month , the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors .

MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI , formerly known as WorldCom , agreed not to mislead investors about its finances , and to improve internal controls , the Journal said .



The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions , swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on , the report said .



Separately , former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars , plus interest , on a 400-million - dollar loan from MCI , the Journal said , citing SEC documents .

" No to injustice , " " No to occupation , " " No to Israel , " " Yes to Islam , " chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform .



Imam Mohammad al - Fartussi , who last week threatened violence against " sinful " women , alcohol vendors and cinemas showing " indecent " films , offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq " the land of imams ... land of Islam . "

But despite issuing a host of tough decrees , Bremer has failed to stem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the country .



Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and an announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war , ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence .



In Baghdad , almost all the police stations have been destroyed or looted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9 .

" We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but we told them : ' You wo n't be directly elected , you wo n't have any direct experience of government , " the source said .



" ' Of course you will have input into the government but , since you are not directly elected , it would be a nonsense for you to have direct executive power , ' the source said .



" The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self - appointed oligarchs in power , " the source said .



The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for internationally - supervised elections in Iraq .



Adnan Pachachi , a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq on May 6 after 33 years in exile , told the independent Az - Zaman daily that elections should be held under international supervision .



An interim government should create an election code and laws to clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly , that would draw up a constitution , Pachachi said .



A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new government , the 80-year - old Pachachi told the daily .



On the diplomatic front , a top Russian official said Monday that the UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US - British draft resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition control for at least a year .

Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution , which diplomats have been revising since the United States , Britain and Spain first submitted it more than a week ago .



Russia " will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to be , " he said .



With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq , Russia has been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting the resolution .



Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to help Iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol in recovering looted ancient artefacts .

The shorter Chinese route , a 2,400-kilometre project , would cost around half the Japanese pipeline , at 2.5 billion dollars ( 2.15 billion euros ) , and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes a year to be economic .



China , whose booming economy has turned the country into an increasingly valuable economic partner for Russia , especially in its backward far eastern regions , is also a major purchaser of Russian weapons .

Analysts however cautioned against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance , given that both sides opposed the war in Iraq .

" A lot can be said for an amicable , neighbourly relationship between Moscow and Beijing and this is what the rapport should serve , " he added .

Swapping smiles , handshakes and hugs at a joint press appearance after talks linked to Saint Petersburg 's 300th anniversary celebrations , Bush and Putin set out to recreate the buddy atmosphere of their previous encounters .



" Our relations are stronger than the events that tested it , " said Putin , stressing that despite diverging over Iraq , Russia and the United States had many common interests .

But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russian aid to the nuclear program of Iran , whom Bush has labeled part of an " axis of evil " that also included Iraq and North Korea .



" We are concerned about Iran 's advanced nuclear program and urge Iran to comply in full with its obligations under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty , " Bush said .

" Our belief is that any proliferation , coming from any source , should be stopped . "

Putin insisted that the two sides were " closer than they seem " on the issue .



" We do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , " he said .



But in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie , Putin warned Russia was not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with Iran .



" We are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program in Iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us , " he said .



Bush signalled that Russia would not pay a similar price as France and Germany for opposing the US - led war in Iraq , inviting his " good friend " Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washington in September .

Hunter , 34 , filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court , citing irreconcilable differences with the 58-year - old rock star to whom she has been married for nearly 13 years .



How the assets of the couple -- they have a daughter , Renee , 11 , and a son , Liam , 8 -- will divided has yet to be decided , the documents showed .

White House raises possibility it might not seek U.N. vote With EU - GEN -- Turkey - US - Iraq ; UN - GEN -- N - Iraq



WASHINGTON ( AP )



With opposition hardening , the White House left open the possibility Tuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on its war - making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat .



`` The vote is desirable .



It is not necessary , '' presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said .



The comments came as President George W. Bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations buildup to potential war .



One option under serious consideration was Bush giving Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a final ultimatum , perhaps with a short - term deadline , in a major address next week , two senior White House officials said .

The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a U.N. Security Council debate on the U.S .- backed war resolution .



The United States still does n't have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution , according to supporters and opponents , and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise .
27,29 ORG-AFF.Membership
27,29 ORG-AFF.Membership

Even if he gets the required votes , Bush needs to avoid a veto by Russia , France or China who all favor continuing inspections at least into July .



Once the vote is resolved one way or another , Bush will intensify his case for war , officials said , barring unforeseen events such as Saddam suddenly disarming or going into exile .



In addition to a possible address , they have discussed a presidential news conference and a Cabinet meeting as ways for Bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week .



As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes , Fleischer told reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $ 15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraq conflict .

27,31 PHYS.Located

`` The particular package that we 've been talking to them about was predicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against Iraq , '' Fleischer said .



Until Tuesday , the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to Turkey regardless of whether 62,000 American troops are allowed in the country .
15,22 PHYS.Located|20,22 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity

Even so , officials said future aid for Turkey would not be ruled out , just the massive package under consideration now .

Russia 's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov , hardening Moscow 's opposition to quick military action , indicated Russia may use its veto against the U.S .- backed resolution .

Both developments further complicated Bush 's efforts to win passage of the resolution , adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if U.N. opposition cements against the U.S. position .



`` The president has made clear , that ... whether the United Nations votes or does not vote , that we will disarm Saddam Hussein with a coalition of the willing , '' Fleischer said .



`` We are proceeding with all the plans for the vote . ''



`` Now , if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around the world crumbles and there is absolutely no one for it , I ca n't predict with metaphysical certitude every eventuality , '' Fleischer said .



U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte was asked whether the United States would withdraw the resolution if it did n't have the votes to pass it .

`` We have n't crossed that bridge , '' he said .



`` We believe that support should be there .

Emboldened by U.N. report , Iraq calls for end to sanctions



BAGHDAD , Iraq ( AP )

0,3 PART-WHOLE.Geographical

Emboldened by the latest weapons inspectors ' report , Iraq on Saturday called on the United Nations to remove crippling sanctions and to ban weapons of mass destruction in the entire Middle East _ and eventually in the United States .



Iraq resumed destroying banned Al Samoud 2 missiles under U.N. supervision Saturday after taking a day off , crushing six more in a process that chief inspector Hans Blix called a `` substantial measure of disarmament . ''



In the past week , Iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 Al Samoud 2 missiles , prohibited by the United Nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) .



It also has been destroying equipment used to make them .



Reports to the Security Council on Friday by Blix and chief nuclear inspector Mohammed ElBaradei praised Iraq 's recent compliance .



But inspectors also questioned Iraq 's motivation , as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate .



U.S. President George W. Bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make Iraq disarm .
0,2 ORG-AFF.Employment
0,2 ORG-AFF.Employment

`` Unfortunately , it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still violating the demands of the United Nations by refusing to disarm , '' he told Americans in a radio address Saturday .



Iraq , however , took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled , but that sanctions imposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be removed .



`` We demand that the Security Council and the world decide on ... the lifting of sanctions on Iraq in a comprehensive and complete way , '' said a spokesman for a meeting Saturday of Saddam and top - level officials , quoted by official Iraqi news media .

The unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified Iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction _ something the inspectors said would take months to do _ and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond Iraq : to Israel , and eventually to the United States .



The spokesman , reporting on the meeting , said Iraq called on the Security Council `` to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction since Iraq has become free of them . ''



`` At the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the Zionist entity , '' he said in a reference to Israel , adding that the order should `` move on after this region to America . ''



The newspaper Babil , a popular daily owned by Saddam 's son Odai , also said Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions , which are to be removed when the United Nations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them .

Three of the missiles had warheads and three did n't , apparently because they had n't been deployed .

Interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors do n't mind the scientists tape recording the interviews , a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams .



Inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991 .



Ueki said inspectors there took samples from the remainders of stainless steel containers Iraq says it used to transport biological agents .

The court order was requested by Jack Welch 's attorney , Daniel K. Webb , who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings , his health and entries in his personal diary .



Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches ' previous marriages were likely to come up , and cited reports of alleged extramarital affairs by both .



Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a financial affidavit .



That document detailed monthly outlays of some $ 51,000 for upkeep on a half - dozen houses scattered from Massachusetts to Florida , more than $ 52,000 for gifts and nearly $ 9,000 for food and drink , among other expenses .
