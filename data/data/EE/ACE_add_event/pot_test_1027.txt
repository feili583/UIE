BAGHDAD , May 19 ( AFP )



Shiite Muslims in Iraq Monday celebrated openly for the first time in decades Prophet Mohammed ' s birthday , as continuing anarchy and chaos threatened to undermine US efforts to rebuild the war - ravaged country .



Meanwhile coalition officials in Iraq insisted plans for an Iraqi government were still on track and Russia hinted that a compromise could be imminent on a UN draft resolution to lift economic sanctions on Iraq .



Thousands of Iraq ' s majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam ' s founder Prophet Mohammed .

Shiites , who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims , were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam Hussein ' s Sunni - dominated regime .



The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in the northeast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam , calling for good government .

" No to injustice ," " No to occupation ," " No to Israel ," " Yes to Islam ," chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform .



Imam Mohammad al - Fartussi , who last week threatened violence against " sinful " women , alcohol vendors and cinemas showing " indecent " films , offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq " the land of imams ... land of Islam ."



The demonstration came as Iraq ' s top US overseer Paul Bremer began his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the country .

Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and an announcement that some 7 , 000 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war , ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence .

In Baghdad , almost all the police stations have been destroyed or looted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9 .



Only two have so far reopened , and they have no equipment whatsoever .



Baghdad ' s top police job remains vacant .



And a trip to Baghdad ' s looter market only bears witness to the fact that criminals are ruling the roost in the post - Saddam era .



Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of theft that followed the collapse of Saddam ' s regime , the traders deal in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons .



Jalal Jamil , a 45 - year - old jewellery store owner , said the situation just keeps getting worse .



" The Americans encourage people to steal because when looting happens right under their noses they do nothing ," he said .



Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier US timeline on forming a government in Iraq , but US - led coalition officials Monday insisted government plans were still on track .



" We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that precipitously ," said a source at the Organisation of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance ( ORHA ), which is administering post - war Iraq .

On the diplomatic front , a top Russian official said Monday that the UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US - British draft resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition control for at least a year .



" An updated text of the document may already be published today and may be put to a vote this week ," Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov told ITAR - TASS news agency .



Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution , which diplomats have been revising since the United States , Britain and Spain first submitted it more than a week ago .



Russia " will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to be ," he said .



With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq , Russia has been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting the resolution .



Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to help Iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol in recovering looted ancient artefacts .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( AP )



Emboldened by the latest weapons inspectors ' report , Iraq on Saturday called on the United Nations to remove crippling sanctions and to ban weapons of mass destruction in the entire Middle East _ and eventually in the United States .



Iraq resumed destroying banned Al Samoud 2 missiles under U . N . supervision Saturday after taking a day off , crushing six more in a process that chief inspector Hans Blix called a `` substantial measure of disarmament .''



In the past week , Iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 Al Samoud 2 missiles , prohibited by the United Nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ).



It also has been destroying equipment used to make them .



Reports to the Security Council on Friday by Blix and chief nuclear inspector Mohammed ElBaradei praised Iraq ' s recent compliance .



But inspectors also questioned Iraq ' s motivation , as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate .

`` Unfortunately , it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still violating the demands of the United Nations by refusing to disarm ,'' he told Americans in a radio address Saturday .



Iraq , however , took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled , but that sanctions imposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be removed .

The unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified Iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction _ something the inspectors said would take months to do _ and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond Iraq : to Israel , and eventually to the United States .



The spokesman , reporting on the meeting , said Iraq called on the Security Council `` to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction since Iraq has become free of them .''

6,7 Contact:Meet|6,10 Entity

`` At the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the Zionist entity ,'' he said in a reference to Israel , adding that the order should `` move on after this region to America .''



The newspaper Babil , a popular daily owned by Saddam ' s son Odai , also said Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions , which are to be removed when the United Nations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them .



In a front - page editorial , Babil said the reports should push Security Council members `` to think seriously about issuing a resolution lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq , since it was proven that we don ' t possess weapons of mass destruction .''



Saddam has long claimed Iraq destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .



The United States and Britain claim he ' s lying , and have assembled a quarter - million troops around Iraq for a possible invasion .

Bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone through the weekend and up until next week ' s planned vote on the ultimatum .



French President Jacques Chirac talked to heads of state in an effort to drum up support for his plan , his office said .



Inspectors ' spokesman Hiro Ueki said Iraqi workers crushed six Al Samoud 2 missiles Saturday at the al - Taji military complex north of Baghdad , under the supervision of weapons inspectors .



Three of the missiles had warheads and three didn ' t , apparently because they hadn ' t been deployed .



Inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and `` special equipment used to produce the Al Samoud 2 engine '' at the Al Samoud factory , he said , and another group of inspectors verified the emptying of Al Samoud 2 warheads at the Qa Qa complex just south of Baghdad .



Odai al - Taie , a senior Information Ministry official , said the workers crushing the missiles took Friday off because they had worked on Tuesday , the Muslim new year .



Ueki described Friday as a `` planning day '' for teams working on missile destruction .



Ueki said an Iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weapons inspectors , bringing to eight the number of scientists who have given interviews since Feb . 28 , when Iraq began urging them to talk .



Since the same date , four scientists have refused .



Interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors don ' t mind the scientists tape recording the interviews , a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams .



Inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991 .

The Hong Kong club is a charitable entity , while the Macau Jockey Club is a for - profit concern controlled by gambling tycoon Stanley Ho .



Hong Kong angered Macau ' s gaming industry last year when it banned gamblers in Hong Kong from placing horse bets with anyone but the Hong Kong Jockey Club .



Macau had been taking off - track bets from people in Hong Kong , but the offices handling those wagers were closed .



The Macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on Hong Kong races in Macau , at a better price for gamblers because less tax would be levied , but the plan never materialized .



Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The Associated Press to inquire about the buyout talks .

" Heidi ' s ideas , her background , her knowledge have helped us a great deal ," he said .



" The international novelty value with Heidi promoting it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere ."



But it hasn ' t been an easy road to the Australian Stock Exchange since the idea was first mooted in 1994 .



" The establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange ," Harris said .



" It ' s only because we were the biggest and the best that we could afford to do it .



" We have fought every institution , every law firm ... it ' s cost us a fortune but now we ' re going on a massive expansion ."



Harris said Sydney was a more attractive option for the sex Disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than Melbourne ' s .



" Prostitution is completely decriminalised in Sydney and we are going to build a monster ," he said .

WASHINGTON ( AP )



With opposition hardening , the White House left open the possibility Tuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on its war - making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat .
23,24 Conflict:Attack|5,24 Attacker|6,24 Attacker
23,24 Conflict:Attack|5,24 Attacker

`` The vote is desirable .



It is not necessary ,'' presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said .



The comments came as President George W . Bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations buildup to potential war .

One option under serious consideration was Bush giving Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a final ultimatum , perhaps with a short - term deadline , in a major address next week , two senior White House officials said .



The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a U . N . Security Council debate on the U . S .- backed war resolution .

43,44 Contact:Meet|29,44 Entity

The United States still doesn ' t have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution , according to supporters and opponents , and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise .



Even if he gets the required votes , Bush needs to avoid a veto by Russia , France or China who all favor continuing inspections at least into July .



Once the vote is resolved one way or another , Bush will intensify his case for war , officials said , barring unforeseen events such as Saddam suddenly disarming or going into exile .
16,17 Conflict:Attack|10,17 Attacker

As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes , Fleischer told reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $ 15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraq conflict .

`` The particular package that we ' ve been talking to them about was predicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against Iraq ,'' Fleischer said .
26,27 Conflict:Attack|5,27 Attacker|26,29 Place
26,27 Conflict:Attack|5,27 Attacker|26,29 Place

Until Tuesday , the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to Turkey regardless of whether 62 , 000 American troops are allowed in the country .



White House officials said they were turning up pressure on Turkey in hopes that the parliament would grant the U . S . request on a second vote .



Even so , officials said future aid for Turkey would not be ruled out , just the massive package under consideration now .



At the United Nations , Secretary - General Kofi Annan called Baghdad ' s missile destruction `` a positive development ,'' putting him at odds with Bush ' s assessment .



Russia ' s Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov , hardening Moscow ' s opposition to quick military action , indicated Russia may use its veto against the U . S .- backed resolution .



Both developments further complicated Bush ' s efforts to win passage of the resolution , adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if U . N . opposition cements against the U . S . position .



`` The president has made clear , that ... whether the United Nations votes or does not vote , that we will disarm Saddam Hussein with a coalition of the willing ,'' Fleischer said .



`` We are proceeding with all the plans for the vote .''



`` Now , if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around the world crumbles and there is absolutely no one for it , I can ' t predict with metaphysical certitude every eventuality ,'' Fleischer said .



U . S .



Ambassador John Negroponte was asked whether the United States would withdraw the resolution if it didn ' t have the votes to pass it .



`` We haven ' t crossed that bridge ,'' he said .



`` We believe that support should be there .



We are not facing that kind of situation but we will cross the bridge when we come to it .''



Afterward , he and other White House officials said the remarks did not signal a lack of confidence in the resolution ' s prospects .



SEOUL , April 25 ( AFP )



US allegations that North Korea admitted to possessing nuclear weapons triggered alarm across Asia Friday and prompted appeals for calm from world capitals .



The admission , according to US sources , came during three - day talks in Beijing which concluded Friday , the first meeting between US and North Korean officials since the nuclear crisis erupted six months ago .



China expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alive while officials in Moscow and London called for patience in resolving the complex impasse .



South Korea and Japan were cautious , with Seoul Foreign Minister Yoon Young - Kwan saying if the North Koreans were telling the truth , it would represent a " major " threat to peace in Northeast Asia .



US sources with authoritative knowledge of the Beijing meetings said the head of the North Korean delegation Li Gun had confirmed to US envoy James Kelly that the Stalinist state had developed nuclear weapons and hinted it may sell or use them , depending on US actions .

" They said what we always knew , that they do have weapons ," one US source said .



" That doesn ' t shock us , we have been saying it .



Now they have said it ."



Li also told Kelly that North Korea had gone ahead with reprocessing 8 , 000 spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon plant , which could produce enough weapons grade plutonium for several more nuclear bombs , said the sources who requested anonymity .



An angry US President George W . Bush accused Pyongyang of reverting to blackmail following the nuclear admission and North Korea fired back with a charge that Washington had rejected a " bold " plan to resolve the six - month - old impasse .



The outcome of the talks plunged financial markets into freefall in Seoul with analysts saying they saw no sign of a recovery any time soon .



Despite the leaked details about the meetings , US officials publicly declined to confirm any of North Korea ' s announcements , with US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher saying comments made by North Koreans " require careful analysis ."



China , playing host to the talks , tried to put a positive spin on the talks which Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said signified " a good beginning ."



" We hope that all sides can continue to make efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean nuclear issue ," Li was quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying .



He said Korean nuclear issue was " very complicated and sensitive ," but the key was to " not mind the other side ' s rhetoric ," but " pay attention to its actions ."



A top Russian foreign ministry official called for patience and Britain ' s Foreign Secretary Jack Straw echoed the call in a BBC radio interview .



Kelly , the US assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs , arrived in Seoul from Beijing Friday to brief Yoon , the foreign minister .

" If it is true that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons , this would be a major breach of peace on the Korean peninsula as well as in Northeast Asia ," said Yoon .



Kelly , who declined to talks to reporters here , travels to Tokyo Sunday for talks with Japanese officials .

He has made no public comments so far on the Beijing talks .



However US Secretary of State Colin Powell said the talks had featured " strong views " on all sides and insisted that the United States would not bow to blackmail , threats or " bellicose statements ."



North Korea , in its first official comment on the outcome of the talks , accused Washington of ruling out Pyongyang ' s " bold " plan for peace while offering nothing new itself .



A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman , quoted by the official Korean Central News Agency , made no reference to the reports that North Korea had admitted to possessing nuclear weapons .



" At the talks the DPRK ( North Korea ) set forth a new bold proposal to clear up bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the US , and the parties concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula , at the same time ," the unnamed official was quoted as saying .



" The US , however , repeated its old assertion that the DPRK should ' scrap its nuclear program before dialogue ' without advancing any new proposal at the talks ."



The official did not disclose what North Korea ' s bold plan was .

As coalition troops advanced , an entire Iraqi army division gave itself up , U . S . military officials said .



The division _ the 51st Infantry Division , with 8 , 000 men and as many as 200 tanks , a key unit in the defense of Basra _ was the largest defection in a day when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ' s forces showed signs of crumbling .



Allied successes were marred by the collision of two Royal Navy helicopters over the Persian Gulf in which all six British crew members and one American were killed .

LONDON , May 9 ( AFP )



A ground - breaking British budget cinema chain launched by the founder of low - cost airline easyJet announced Friday that it had finally acquired some films to show -- just a fortnight before it first opens .

EasyCinema , which aims to sell tickets to its no - frills cinemas for as little as 20 pence ( 0 . 28 euros , 0 . 32 dollars ), has been locked in a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for titles .



Rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors , easyCinema wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first - run movies over a fixed period , a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors .



EasyCinema founder Stelios Haji - Ioannou , who set up easyJet in 1995 and built it up into Europe ' s biggest budget airline , has vowed to take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow him access .

The deadlock , and subsequent lack of any films , has been threatening to de - rail the debut of easyCinema ' s first outlet in Milton Keynes , just north of London , which is due to open its doors on May 23 .

However the firm announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with the British arm of French distributors Pathe to show four releases .



While not the latest Hollywood blockbusters , these include titles such as as recently - released US martial arts picture " Bulletproof Monk " and new British 1930s - based weepie " The Heart of Me ".



Haji - Ioannou professed himself " delighted ", but promised to push ahead in his battle with other distributors .



" The situation with the top six UK distributors representing more than 90 percent of the market is still in a deadlock ," he said .

SINGAPORE , May 30 ( AFP )



Singapore doctors will proceed with an unpredecented and risky operation to separate a pair of adult Iranian twins joined at the head , a hospital official said Friday .



The official , who asked not to be named , said the decision to go ahead with the operation is expected to be announced to the media on Monday by doctors and executives of Raffles Hospital , where the surgery will be carried out .



A team of specialists here have been conducting tests on the female twins , Laleh and Ladan Bijani , since last year to determine if the operation can be successful .



The twins , both qualified lawyers aged in their late 20s , are joined at the head and the operation involves separating two individually functioning brains encased within a single bony structure , neurosurgeon Keith Goh said in December .



The pair flew to Singapore last year after hearing of the successful surgery on Nepalese babies Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha , who were separated in a 97 - hour operation at a hospital here .

Leaders of the two Asian giants , according to UFG financial brokerage , may ink a deal for the construction of a 2 , 400 kilometre ( 1 , 500 - mile ) oil pipeline from eastern Siberia to the Chinese city of Daqing , bringing Russian crude to energy - hungry China .



Although the Russian government is formally committed to building an extension of the pipeline that would supply Japan through the Russian port of Nakhodka , experts believe that project is unlikely to see the light of day .



Russian oil giant Yukos , whose output will be shipped through the pipeline , had lobbied furiously for the Chinese route although the state pipeline monopoly Transneft argued that it was wrong to tie strategic Russian energy resources to the whims of a single buyer .



" Single customers are always a danger .



However , the project makes economic sense ," commented Asia expert Dmitry Trenin , deputy director in Moscow of the Carnegie Center , a Washington - based think tank .



The shorter Chinese route , a 2 , 400 - kilometre project , would cost around half the Japanese pipeline , at 2 . 5 billion dollars ( 2 . 15 billion euros ), and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes a year to be economic .



China , whose booming economy has turned the country into an increasingly valuable economic partner for Russia , especially in its backward far eastern regions , is also a major purchaser of Russian weapons .



" It ' s a very important relationship .



China is a very dynamic neighbour and a rising world power .



In many ways it is far ahead of Russia ," Trenin said .



The Chinese president expressed the hope that bilateral trade could be raised from its current level of 12 billion dollars a year to 20 billion dollars .



Analysts however cautioned against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance , given that both sides opposed the war in Iraq .

" The Chinese are trying to establish a rapport ( between Hu and Putin ) and this is in Russia ' s interests .



However , this rapport should not serve the role of forming an alliance to counter American dominance in the world ," said Trenin .



" A lot can be said for an amicable , neighbourly relationship between Moscow and Beijing and this is what the rapport should serve ," he added .



WASHINGTON , May 19 ( AFP )



MCI , formerly WorldCom , and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant ' s 11 - billion - dollar ( 9 . 4 - billion - euro ) fraud case , The Wall Street Journal reported Monday .



Under terms of the agreement , to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case , MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker - dealer , the Journal said , citing sources close to the matter .

MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI , formerly known as WorldCom , agreed not to mislead investors about its finances , and to improve internal controls , the Journal said .



The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions , swelling from the initially announced 3 . 5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on , the report said .



Separately , former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars , plus interest , on a 400 - million - dollar loan from MCI , the Journal said , citing SEC documents .

SAINT PETERSBURG , June 1 ( AFP ) - US President George W . Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday their friendship was as strong as ever , laying aside a dispute over the Iraq war , but barely concealing a simmering row over Iran ' s nuclear program .

" Our relations are stronger than the events that tested it ," said Putin , stressing that despite diverging over Iraq , Russia and the United States had many common interests .



" It is precisely these things that enable me to call President Bush my friend , not only personally -- because I do like him a lot -- but as my counterpart and the president of a friendly nation ," he said , earning a grin from Bush .



But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russian aid to the nuclear program of Iran , whom Bush has labeled part of an " axis of evil " that also included Iraq and North Korea .

" We are concerned about Iran ' s advanced nuclear program and urge Iran to comply in full with its obligations under the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ," Bush said .



A senior US diplomat said Bushehr remains one of the biggest irritants in Russia - US relations .



" We think that it would be wise for Russia to go slow on the Bushehr project until the wider Iranian nuclear program is more clearly understood ," the US diplomat said after the informal summit talks .

" Our belief is that any proliferation , coming from any source , should be stopped ."



The United States believes that what Iran says is a peaceful civilian nuclear program is a pretext for weapons manufacture .



Washington has been pressuring Russia to stop building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr , southern Iran , which it has so far declined to do .



" I appreciate Vladimir Putin ' s understanding of the issue and his willingness to work with me and others to solve this potential problem ," said Bush .



Putin insisted that the two sides were " closer than they seem " on the issue .



" We do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ," he said .



But in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie , Putin warned Russia was not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with Iran .



" We are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program in Iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us ," he said .



Bush signalled that Russia would not pay a similar price as France and Germany for opposing the US - led war in Iraq , inviting his " good friend " Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washington in September .

There was no word on the fate of billions of dollars of Russian oil contracts in Iraq , whose oil industry is now under the administration of the United States and Britain in line with latest UN resolutions , which Russia was persuaded to back .



But Putin noted that " Russian companies have a wealth of experience operating in Iraq and we intend to continue our cooperation in this area , with Iraq and in Iraq ."



" What the president ( Putin ) meant was that at times , and we have come across this , there were unreasonable complaints about Russian companies ' cooperation with Iran ," said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov , pointing the finger clearly at the United States after the summit .

The charismatic leader of Turkey ' s governing party was named prime minister Tuesday , a step that probably boosts chances that the United States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along Iraq ' s northern border .

In Washington , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen . Richard Myers told a Pentagon news conference Tuesday that the United States would `` have a northern option whether or not Turkey fully supports all our requests .



`` I ' m not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it , but just be assured there will be a northern option ,'' he said .

" Sooner or later Iraq will fall and Russia and the United Sates will resume normal relations ," the senior Moscow official , who was reported to be close to Putin , told the paper .



" The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an argument with the United States ."



The comments indicate that Russia ' s nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W . Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials .

This is only the start of a massive US campaign ( to decide Iraq ' s future finances )."

" On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate ," Putin said .



" Russia has no objections to such a proposal ."



Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post - war revival of Iraq .

The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders before the US - British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential for any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .

And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti - Washington stance of Schroeder and Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush .



Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Bush ' s staunchest backer in the war on Iraq , to attend the pow - wow in Saint Petersburg ' s Grand Hotel Europe , although diplomats said Blair turned the offer down .

NKorea offers to scrap nuke , missile programs but wants big concessions : US



by Matthew Lee



ATTENTION - UPDATES ///



WASHINGTON , April 28 ( AFP ) - North Korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs , but only in return for " considerable " diplomatic , political and economic concessions , the United States said Monday .



Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three - way talks between US , North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing .

At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons , and threatened to prove it with a " display ."

" The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and , in effect , said that these are now up for further discussion ," he told reporters at the State Department .



" They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities , but they , of course , expect something considerable in return ," Powell said .



" We are studying that plan , we are examining it with our friends and allies ," Powell said , adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean , Japanese , Russian and Australian as well as other governments .

" It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here ," he said , referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing .

Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer , and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions .



However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands .



The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States , security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations .



" They had quite a list of things ," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters .



Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance , Boucher replied : " I don ' t really quibble with that characterization of the list ."



A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a " concise description ."



" It basically listed everything they have ever asked for ," the official told reporters on condition of anonymity , identifying oil and energy supplies as demands .



Although the North Korean demands are being looked at , Boucher repeated long - standing US policy that Washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off .



" We ' ve made clear we ' re not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place ," he said .



Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks , but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words " test " or " testing ."



" They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another ," he said .



The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a " bold " proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing , officials said .



South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six - month - old nuclear crisis .



Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides , stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the " verifiable and irreversible termination " of the north ' s nuclear programs .



" We ( have ) made clear that once North Korea did that , we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to US - North Korea relations that we had talked about before ," he said .



South Korea ' s Munhwa Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed South Korean government sources as saying Pyongyang also urged Washington not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with Seoul and Tokyo .



The North ' s ruling Workers Party newspaper , Rodong Sinmun , indicated Sunday that North Korea wanted economic and political " rewards " from the United States in return for the elimination of its nuclear program .



Rodong called for a " fair and equal " footing in talks with the United States , blasting Washington for insisting that there would be " no security of the system nor provision of rewards " even if Pyongyang gave up its nuclear program .

NEW DELHI , June 7 ( AFP )



A provincial chief from India ' s main opposition Congress party has told an election rally that India is suffering nature ' s " curse " because both the president and prime minister are bachelors , a report said Saturday .



The Times of India newspaper quoted Digvijay Singh , chief minister of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh , as saying that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Abdul Kalam had offended the Hindu rain God Varuna by remaining bachelors .



" The country is being ruled by a bachelor president and an unmarried prime minister .



This according to the Hindu shastras ( books ) is very inauspicious and that is the reason there is a widespread heatwave and drought ," said Singh .



" Not just Prime Minister Vajpayee but President Kalam ' s bachelor status is making the country dry , arid and infertile ," he added .



The general secretary of Vajpayee ' s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party , Pramod Mahajan , retorted that Singh ' s statement was " beneath contempt ."



India ' s has been reeling under a heatwave since mid - May which has killed 1 , 403 people .

Traffic was flowing freely through the Netzarim junction , just south of Gaza City , the Kissufim junction by Deir al - Balah in the central Gaza Strip , and the Guest House junction just south of Deir al - Balah after the army withdrew .



The three military checkpoints on the highway , which runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip , had transformed the trip from north to south , ordinarily a 30 - minute ride , into a grinding two or three - hour ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation .



" Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues ," the source said , pointing out that Israel had still not removed two military observation posts at the Kissufim junction and the Guest House junction .



Although there was free movement along the trans - Gaza highway , several other roads remained temporarily closed , he said .



The Karni - Netzarim road , which runs east - to - west across the route , was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by Kfar Darom settlement , just south of the Guest House junction , he said , adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks .



Another road , leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis , would be opened within 10 days , he said .



Adressing Palestinian complaints , an Israeli military source confirmed troops had installed a gate at the Netzarim crossing and at the southern Guest House junction but said that they were only there for when Jewish settlers needed to use the road .



A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on Monday or early Tuesday .



The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians , security sources said .



Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing , which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising .

Under the 1993 Oslo accords , which granted a measure of autonomy to the Palestinians , the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was to be jointly managed by both Israel and the Palestinians , although Israel had final control over the zone .



Although the crossing has , in principle , been open for movement between the two territories -- while being frequently closed by Israeli for reasons rarely explained -- the Palestinian section has been manned by Israel for more than two years .
