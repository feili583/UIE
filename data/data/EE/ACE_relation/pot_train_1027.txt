POLLACK Well , if it 's true and obviously we do n't know just yet but if it 's true , it is very significant because it 's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we 've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas .

also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .

if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .

why call it off ?



there 's a number of reasons to look at .



depending on the water temperature , it 's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .



also the reason for the 24-hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time .

the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the red planet .

one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit .
6,7 LOC|11,12 PER|6,12 PHYS.Located
6,7 LOC|11,12 PER|6,12 PHYS.Located

it 's an idea plagued with unsolved problems .

good to see you , jeff .
5,6 PER
5,6 PER

thank you .



it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon .
12,13 LOC
12,13 LOC

so what 's the difficulty in being able to go to mars ?
11,12 LOC
11,12 LOC

it 's unimaginably difficult and different .



mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us .
0,1 LOC
0,1 LOC

it 's a nine - month trip .



then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .



we 're talking about conditions where there 's radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer .
10,11 LOC
10,11 LOC

the communications conditions once you 're on mars , just to talk to people on earth , there 's a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
7,8 LOC|13,14 PER|15,16 LOC|13,16 PHYS.Located
7,8 LOC|13,14 PER|15,16 LOC|13,16 PHYS.Located

so the -- you know , the issues are so much larger than going to the moon . and for now , it 's 250 days , which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway .
16,17 LOC|34,35 PER|36,37 LOC|34,37 PHYS.Located
16,17 LOC|34,35 PER|36,37 LOC|34,37 PHYS.Located

but as you say , it 's a much further travel .



but let 's talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there .
11,12 PER
11,12 PER

the dust , for one thing .



cataracts another .



let 's talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive .
8,9 VEH|15,16 PER
8,9 VEH|15,16 PER

right .



well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth .
7,8 VEH|13,14 LOC
7,8 VEH|13,14 LOC

you 'd have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space .
8,9 LOC|20,21 LOC
8,9 LOC|20,21 LOC

so that means we need a good shuttle that 's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft .
7,8 VEH|20,21 VEH
7,8 VEH|20,21 VEH

then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth 's orbit all the way to mars .
16,17 LOC|23,24 LOC
16,17 LOC|23,24 LOC

that 's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we have n't really developed yet , because we could n't carry that much fuel , obviously .



liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars .
13,14 LOC
13,14 LOC

the bigger issue is once we get there , we ca n't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we 're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet . and think of it .
37,38 LOC|40,41 LOC|37,41 PART-WHOLE.Geographical
37,38 LOC|40,41 LOC|37,41 PART-WHOLE.Geographical

mars is carbon dioxide .
0,1 LOC
0,1 LOC

so we ca n't breathe there .



so we 're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself .
29,30 LOC
29,30 LOC

all of this is in the works now , but i think it 's going to take quite a few years to develop it .



you talk about the cosmic radiation .



then of course there is the zero g bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well .
18,19 PER
18,19 PER

absolutely .



there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronauts in mars .
11,12 PER|13,14 LOC|11,14 PHYS.Located
11,12 PER|13,14 LOC|11,14 PHYS.Located

why ?



during the time in mars .
4,5 LOC
4,5 LOC

because when the body has -- when there is no dpravity as there is on mars , the body does n't pick up the calcium in the bones , so it does n't keep getting the bones stronger and stronger .
3,4 PER|15,16 LOC|18,19 PER

It 's a good topic .



Gandhi So what do you think ?
0,1 PER
0,1 PER

Marco Well , um , I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start , generally , in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me , one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel .
0,1 PER|35,37 GPE|54,56 GPE|56,57 GPE|63,64 GPE|65,66 GPE
0,1 PER|35,37 GPE|54,56 GPE|56,57 GPE|63,64 GPE|65,66 GPE

In which , the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons , ah , which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians .

4,5 GPE|6,7 GPE|12,13 WEA|29,30 PER|4,13 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer

So , for me , that 's -- the- that 's essentially the root of the problem .



And , um , Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned , uh , Palestinians , and if -- Arafat had n't , um , tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights , then -- m- they would n't have respected Arafat , but then again , you know , he could n't be too friendly with the West , um , and , um , and so he did the best he could , I think .

And the question is , what next ?



I mean , some idea -- from Israeli side , they were saying -- he was a problem , and if he goes , everything will be quite easy .

Marco But , I , eh , I get the feeling that- -- It 's almost- -- The peace process- We ca n't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the pre- -- peace process ca n't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I do n't know , in my view , has -- not ver- not very many resources to fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land , that , you know , does n't allow them to really move around in their own country .

The surprise move by France , which led opposition to the U.S. war against Iraq , followed last week 's call by U.S. President George W. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly , so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction .

Re : Good Morning Iraq

Let 's see ...



There two main qualities to be desired in a Commander - in - Chief , Generalship and Leadership .
9,14 PER
9,14 PER

Because in the United States the Commander - in - Chief is a purely political post , generalship is usually undertaken by the generals proper under the Commander - in - Chief , provided it is understood that the Commander - in - Chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for the outcomes of his general 's generalship .
3,5 GPE|6,11 PER|23,24 PER|27,32 PER|39,44 PER|54,55 PER|3,7 ORG-AFF.Employment|4,7 ORG-AFF.Employment|3,8 ORG-AFF.Employment|4,8 ORG-AFF.Employment|3,9 ORG-AFF.Employment|4,9 ORG-AFF.Employment|3,10 ORG-AFF.Employment|4,10 ORG-AFF.Employment|3,11 ORG-AFF.Employment|4,11 ORG-AFF.Employment
3,5 GPE|6,11 PER|23,24 PER|27,32 PER|39,44 PER|54,55 PER|3,11 ORG-AFF.Employment

Generalship involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering , strategic and tactical planning , and the communication of orders .



Leadership can be less rigidly defined and is concerned less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his men to fight harder and endure worse privations in order to beat the enemy .
17,18 PER|22,23 PER|35,36 PER
17,18 PER|22,23 PER|35,36 PER

President Bush generalship has proven deficient .
0,1 PER|1,2 PER
0,1 PER|1,2 PER

His planning for the war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances brought by a strong and unexpected insurgency .



The Commander - in - Chief 's generalship can suffice to motivate men if they are higly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general . Eisenhower was in that position .
1,6 PER|12,13 PER|26,27 PER|28,29 PER
1,6 PER|12,13 PER|26,27 PER|28,29 PER

That has not been the case with President Bush , who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence , failed to find any WMD , and left our boys at war wanting for armor . That is not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death .
7,8 PER|8,9 PER|22,23 WEA|27,28 PER|47,48 PER
7,8 PER|8,9 PER|22,23 WEA|27,28 PER|47,48 PER

Men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivated by exceptional leadership .
0,1 PER
0,1 PER

In theory , motivation is best carried out by a commander fighting alongside his men .
10,11 PER|14,15 PER
10,11 PER|14,15 PER

Make no mistake , even when we do n't desire a president with a preference for personal combat , the need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as imperative today as it was in times of Alexander of Macedon .
11,12 PER|23,24 PER|32,33 PER|43,44 PER|45,46 GPE|43,46 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity
11,12 PER|23,24 PER|32,33 PER|43,44 PER|45,46 GPE|43,46 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity

That 's why we look at the military record of our leaders .
7,8 ORG|11,12 PER
7,8 ORG|11,12 PER

John Kennedy , George H. Bush , and even John Kerry , the loser , had distinguished military careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle . The knowledge that the Commander - in - Chief once faced grave danger in war bravely can be the animating spirit of troops facing the same dangers .

In fact , CBS and carrier landings notwithstanding , there is every indication that in the peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could .
3,4 VEH|5,6 VEH
3,4 VEH|5,6 VEH

That is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death .
13,14 PER
13,14 PER

Some might say that George W. Bush is neither a general nor a soldier , he is a politician .
4,7 PER|10,11 PER|13,14 PER|18,19 PER
4,7 PER|10,11 PER|13,14 PER|18,19 PER

He is in charge of Grand Strategy and he delegates the rest .



True .



But as Commander - in - Chief he is the Ultimate General and the First Soldier .
2,7 PER|11,12 PER|15,16 PER

George W. Bush , the Politician , is not very good at grand strategy either .
0,3 PER|5,6 PER

The aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace , and by his several blunders over the psychology of his opponents , the political and economic effects of his actions , and the failure to erradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist , George W.

On the other hand , if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving people from tsunamis , you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event .

8,9 ORG|12,13 GPE|13,14 PER|12,14 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity

Gateway advertised and stickered many of its 486 computers as " Pentium Ready " , meaning that a special Type 3 ZIF socket Pentium OverDrive could be installed and run .

Micronics designed the motherboards used by Gateway , and the basis of the design was a prototype Pentium OverDrive with an internal write - through cache , a more conservative cache design .

Then Intel changed the Pentium OverDrive , and the final version had a write - BACK cache .

When installed in a Gateway system , the chip ran slower than slow , maybe about as fast as an IBM AT , and bus - mastering devices like NICs and SCSI cards refused to work .

4,5 ORG|20,21 ORG

So the lawyers sued Gateway , and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway 486 computers .

So , let 's see .

I wonder how many people gleefully cashed in their coupons and bought Pentium OverDrives from Gateway .

Intel eventually compensated by making available an " interposer " , a little socketed thingie installed between the Pentium OverDrive and the ZIF socket .
0,1 ORG
0,1 ORG

The sole purpose of the interposer was to raise a signal on the CPU to force its cache to operate in the write - thru mode which was compatible with most ZIF Socket 3 486 motherboards .



Needless to say , this was the least successful " OverDrive " CPU ever done by Intel .
16,17 ORG

The 486-DX4 OverDrive was OK , as were several Socket 5 Pentium OverDrives and the Socket 8 Pentium Pro OverDrive .

The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you 're below .05 .



The standard ruse is to throw the keys under the car after you 've unlocked the door ( which you can later claim was unlocked by a person unknown ) .

The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state , she ca n't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction , and that the court wo n't have to initiate the time - consuming process of extraditing her .

The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems , and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward , which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone .

Yes , but according to the facts you first gave , he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares .



I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge did n't come until June of 2004 .



That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors .

If , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them ( e.g. , by putting his assets in the corporation 's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him ) .

Re : [ TAN ] Parole



Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time .



So you 're basically free , with the expectation that you will not leave the state ( assuming you 've been jailed by the state gov't ) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis ( I think they give you a schedule ) .

With roughly three million votes cast in the race , the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some such microscopic amount .



For all intents and purposes it was a tie- but somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it was the demos .

In Washington State , the election has to be not only free and fair , but also " perfect " .

So the if - then statement goes something like this : " if total true Kerry)total true Bush , Bush x 1.04x ( .04 is a random number)(total true Kerry ) , total true Bush " .

15,16 PER|17,18 PER|19,20 PER|29,30 PER|34,35 PER

The second part of the equation takes the total number of votes cast and subtracts the new Bush total , subtracts the third party totals and leaves the rest for Kerry .
17,18 PER|23,24 ORG|30,31 PER

Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place .

11,12 ORG

The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970 's by a group of art historians and collectors , including Frederick Fried , author of the 1964 book " A Pictorial History of The Carousel " that single - handedly gave the classic hand - carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved .

The purpose of the NCA is " to promote conservation , appreciation , knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousels . "

The organization attracted a wide range of members , including carousel enthusiasts , owners / operators , theme and amusement parks , museums , libraries , those in the entertainment / recreation industry , art collectors and even auction houses , among others .

However , this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousels .



They had become worth more money dead ( i.e. in pieces ) than alive ( i.e. functioning ) .



As such , during the 1980 's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block , as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace .

The liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation , as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses , while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable ( thrill ) rides .

Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit , a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization . The increasing rift between the " preservationists " and " collectors " would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the group , including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others .

At this time in the late 1970 's , carousel artwork collector and printer Marge Swenson was the editor of the NCA 's Merry - Go - Roundup publication . The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in two slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership , something that was not supposed to happen .

Coincidentally and amazingly , the art of building hand - carved carousels ( and even bandorgans ) has been revived , with firms such as Carousel Works and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classic design .

This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels over the past several decades .

Club Sports policies at schools ; specifically travel restrictions
0,1 ORG|4,5 ORG
0,1 ORG|4,5 ORG

Hello everyone -



I am attempting to learn more information about the policies of various athletic departments at schools , specifically with regards to ultimate teams .
13,14 ORG|15,16 ORG|22,23 ORG|13,16 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary
13,14 ORG|15,16 ORG|22,23 ORG|13,16 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary

At Northwestern , the Men 's Ultimate team falls under the Club Sports department which falls into a dark , barely lit corner of the Athletic Department .

1,2 ORG|4,5 PER|7,8 ORG|13,14 ORG|26,27 ORG|4,8 ORG-AFF.Sports-Affiliation|7,14 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary

There are some restrictions on what we can and can not do .



The one that I am most interested in comparing to similar policies at other schools concerns our ability to travel .
14,15 ORG
14,15 ORG

At Northwestern , we are allowed to either rent school vans for no charge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles of Evanston , IL .
1,2 ORG|9,10 ORG|10,11 VEH|18,19 VEH|25,26 GPE|27,28 GPE|9,11 ART.User-Owner-Inventor-Manufacturer|25,28 PART-WHOLE.Geographical

Also , we are allowed to fly , take a bus , or take Amtrak to any tournament we want , no matter how far away it is .
10,11 VEH|14,15 VEH
10,11 VEH|14,15 VEH

We are allowed to compete under the Northwestern name if we take any of these options .
7,8 ORG
7,8 ORG

However , it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament farther than 300 miles without flying .



( For example , Regionals is often slightly farther than 300 miles , yet a reasonable drive . ) If we choose to do so , it is understood that we are not officially competing under the Northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimate at a tournament and not involving the university in any way .
37,38 ORG|44,45 ORG|46,47 PER|56,57 ORG

We had been buying the 2-zone all - day tube passes ( 4.20 GBP each ) everyday , just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own , but by the time this was all over , my wife did n't feel like taking the underground back to Heathrow , so we had asked the hotel conceierge to make a reservation on an airport bus ( 15 GBP each ) , but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 GBP , which is what we did .

We have 3 people going , and Expedia shows the flight ( round trip ) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $ 1430 , plus I 'm figuring about $ 150 for gas and at $ 120 a night for hotel that 's $ 360 total for that .

I 'm figuring about $ 850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that 's not bad for 7 nights in New Enland with all the stuff we 're planning .

Hi Everyone ,



Thanks for all the great replies ! !



This is exactly what I 'm looking for :)

14,16 LOC|19,20 GPE
14,16 LOC|19,20 GPE

Is this not accurate ?



Here 's how I figured the price I 'm factoring in -- Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 Miles Niagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles back Niagara Falls to Red Bank , NJ - 435 Miles Red Bank , NJ to Boston ( plus spending some time in NYC ) - 262

14,15 GPE|17,18 GPE
14,15 GPE|17,18 GPE

We 're getting a mid - sized vehicle , so if the car gets 20 mpg that 's 75 gallons used .
7,8 VEH|12,13 VEH
7,8 VEH|12,13 VEH

This times $ 1.90 is $ 145.50 or around that .



Even if gas is $ 2.00 a gallon that 's still only around $ 150 , so I think $ 200 + for gas is a rather high estimate .



Also is it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC ?
7,8 VEH|9,10 GPE|11,12 GPE
7,8 VEH|9,10 GPE|11,12 GPE

Re : Did you miss the inaugural address ?



To put it simply ( for your benefit ) : Lincoln spoke * of * God , demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities ( their religious beliefs among them ) than differences . Dubya spoke * for * God , demanding that we should all fall in line behind him , because he 's got The Plan , and God 's On His Side .

For a slightly different perspective :



" Maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by Enron is nearly double the tariff charged by Indian power producers , and used it as an excuse to stop paying state debts to the plant . "
1,2 GPE|2,3 PER|10,11 ORG|18,19 GPE|20,21 ORG|31,32 GPE|35,36 FAC|1,3 ORG-AFF.Employment|18,21 GEN-AFF.Org-Location

" Enron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility MSEB eight years ago , under which a $ 3bn 2,182 Megawatt power plant was to be commissioned .
1,2 ORG|10,11 ORG|11,12 ORG|24,25 FAC
1,2 ORG|10,11 ORG|11,12 ORG|24,25 FAC

But the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with the Indian authorities beginning to delay payments saying Enron 's power tariff was too high ... Though Enron officials refuse to talk about the price they would be willing to sell their stake at , analysts say the US company is demanding about one billion dollars for its investments in India .

So far it has only got offers of about half that amount from Indian companies and financial institutions , but Enron is unwilling to sell its stake at a price lower than the cost .

In case no satisfactory offer comes from the Indian side , Enron will have little option but to go for international arbitration as their investments in the country were guaranteed by the Indian Government .

11,12 PER|14,15 GPE|16,17 ORG

The best way out could be a compromise by which Enron gets less than what it is demanding and more than what the Indians are presently offering .

IOW : No fraud , just a basic business dispute , in which the party reneging on its obligations is the gov't of Maharashtra . The Maharashtra officials are either incompetent fools , or worse- malicious fraudsters who conned an international comapny into building a state - of - the - art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars , and then refused payment , knowing the company has no legal recourse except lengthy international arbitration , and will likely sell the plant to them for a fraction of its true value .

I 've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid , or at the very least postpone , a war against Japan , mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and did n't need a distraction on another distant front .

The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists , mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked , and let it happen .

However , the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort , on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai , which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort . Even stranger , the USS Enterprise was scheduled to be at Pearl by Dec 6th , but got delayed by a storm .

Consequently , for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm 's way , we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai 's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle , but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed .

To make a very long story short , it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941 , considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war , and the overwhelming lack of evidence ( not to mention rational thought ) arguing for a US desire for war . --

Here 's something I wrote as part of a larger article , some while ago :



Was n't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US ?
2,3 GPE|10,11 GPE
2,3 GPE|10,11 GPE

This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being " driven into a corner " by sanctions , and had no choice but to attack the US .
10,11 GPE|30,31 GPE
10,11 GPE|30,31 GPE

Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West was doing in every facet of society .

They had observed , for example , that the West was able to carve up China into " Spheres of Influence " , and was able to do from great distances , while they , the Japanese , had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula , much less China .

As part of the catch - up effort , she whole - heartedly entered into the Imperialist game in Asia , being treated as an equal ( relative to her power ) by the other powers .
19,20 GPE|25,26 GPE|35,36 GPE
19,20 GPE|25,26 GPE|35,36 GPE

However , after World War I , Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners ; they began a long , slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas , from their colonies , in addition to outright stopping all expansions .
7,8 GPE|21,22 GPE|37,38 LOC|41,42 LOC
7,8 GPE|21,22 GPE|37,38 LOC|41,42 LOC

Japan chose to read this as a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve , and that Japan was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia .

With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan 's rise to international prominence , and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs , in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany , Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area .

Having a keen grasp of the obvious , she began a policy of acceding to Japanese hegemony in the area .
15,16 GPE|19,20 LOC
15,16 GPE|19,20 LOC

Japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand , illusive scheme of a " Greater Asia " , subordinate and grateful to Japan .

The reality of this was that only a single possession , Manchuria , was profitable to the Japanese , and the rest of the Empire turned out to be a drain .

This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan 's invasion of China proper in 1936 .
6,7 GPE|10,11 GPE
6,7 GPE|10,11 GPE

It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in " 3 to 6 months " ; at the time of Pearl Harbor , it had been going on for 5 years , at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives .

The war put a tremendous strain on Japan ( and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements , as taking away from the development of Japan 's other possessions , particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel . ) Domestic consumption fell , consumer goods became scarce , and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan 's domestic industry .

This cut further into her foreign reserves , exacerbating the economic impact of the war .



The war effort took on a life of its own , however , and common sense was subordinated to it .



Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her , but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area ; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler .

At this point , the US stopped ignoring the Japanese threat , and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan , cutting off her scrap metal , limitting and then cutting off her oil ( Japan imported most of both from the US . ) While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED , they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control .

" One feature of the result must not be omitted .



Many careless observers felt at the time that the success of Lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field ; or , in other words , to the dissensions in the Democratic party , which divided its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas .

If all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had been concentrated and cast for a ' fusion ticket , ' as was wholly or partly done in five States , the result would have been changed nowhere except in New Jersey , California , and Oregon ; Lincoln would still have received but 11 fewer , or 169 electoral votes -- majority of 35 in the entire electoral college .

See for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic : the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote ( i.e. , all the free states except Oregon , California , and New Jersey ) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College .

The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer " wasted " votes than his opponents -- in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all .

It can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti - Lincoln opposition might have done better than all the OTL anti - Lincoln candidates combined , because the mere fact of the divided nature of Lincoln 's opposition might have discouraged anti - Lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case .

Records appear to show that 50000 _ men _ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule , finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence , but 10 - 15k seems reasonable

I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners , which this might very well be a precursor to : Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface - to - air missiles ( SAMs ) , referred to as Man - Portable Air Defense Systems ( MANPADS ) , pose to commercial airliners .

Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat .



Instead , a menu of options may be considered , including installing infrared ( IR ) countermeasures on aircraft ; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures ; improving airport and regional security ; and strengthening missile non - proliferation efforts .

But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .



From a European perspective , three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House .

A second reason is Europe 's growing worries about Islamic terrorism . The murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe 's 9/11 . Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable , it is certainly true that American conservatives , such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis , have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance .

2004 - 11 - 03T13:00:00 I am 36 years old .



I 've been around a while .



I 'm not 87 or anything , but I 've seen some things in my life .



I have initially agreed and disagreed with different things over the years , only to have my mind changed later .



However , I will never EVER change my mind about the idiocy we call Daylight Savings Time .



I Googled " Daylight Savings Time " and I got the following link :



http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/



I started reading ...



The site says things like " We 've learned to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the summer " and there 's no S at the end of Savings .



It should be Daylight Saving Time .



My apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and the goobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion .

I will concede that " springing forward " and " falling back " are good ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors . However , New Years and the Fourth of July would do the same thing .



I kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the first person to come up with the idea was Benjamin Franklin who did it on behalf of some friends that owned oil companies ( oil was used in lamps ) .

I assume that , because the idea was dumb and inconvenient , lots of people ignored it . " By 1966 , some 100 million Americans were observing DST based on their own local laws and customs .

Congress decided to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country . The Uniform Time Act of 1966 ( 15 U.S. Code Section 260a ) which was signed into Public Law 89 - 387 on 12 April 1966 , by President Lyndon Johnson , created Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday of April and to end on the last Sunday of October .

Now , I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks ( Warner Communications , which started as a merger between business in the three most mob - influenced industries around , comes to mind ) , but it 's a gamble and not a business strategy .

Video Rentals : The Three Hypotheses



Byrne
0,1 PER
0,1 PER

2004 - 12 - 11T18:45:00 Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year , when it became one of the hottest stocks around ( sporting an eye - popping P / E in the high 900 's on the way up , and , thanks to a poor earnings report , over 1,000 on the way down ) .
6,7 ORG|7,8 ORG
6,7 ORG|7,8 ORG

There 's plenty of argument about the future of DVD and video rental , and Netflix represents a pure - play on one of the three dominant hypotheses :
15,16 ORG
15,16 ORG

I. That business is O - V - E - R -- Between pay - per - view , video - on - demand , pirated movies , high - bandwidth Internet broadcasts , and the increasing availability of other media , it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals .
2,3 ORG

Those who do n't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits .
17,18 ORG|23,24 ORG
17,18 ORG|23,24 ORG

Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films ; they 're the stodgy , expensive way .



There are n't any pure - play buys on this theory , but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all .
23,24 ORG
23,24 ORG

Of course , there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show , and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $ 6 billion by Yahoo ! , to Yahoo ! 's great regret .

6,7 ORG|19,20 ORG|28,29 ORG|36,37 ORG|40,41 ORG

II .



Not so fast -- it 'll just go online ! -- Anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997 , when in terms of time used , text was the most popular kind of information online .



At the time , and for years after , people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete .
9,10 PER|14,15 FAC

As it turns out , of course , Amazon.com , BarnseandNoble.com , and a host of others simply took the bookstore model , attached a 56 K modem , and declared themselves The Future .

III .



Who d'you think you 're kidding ?



You ca n't kill movie rental stores -- So there 's a big difference between movies and books : For books , the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution ; if you do n't sell through them , books wo n't get sold .
6,7 ORG|24,25 FAC|29,30 FAC
6,7 ORG|24,25 FAC|29,30 FAC

6,7 ORG|24,25 ORG
6,7 ORG|24,25 ORG

But given the high valuations ascribed to bricks - and - mortar - and - dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books - A - Million , surely there 's room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two .

By focusing on smaller , rural communities ( preferably the sort that considers DSL ' newfangled ' ) they 're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart 's awful in - store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices .

6,7 GPE|21,22 ORG|25,26 ORG|28,31 FAC

The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows , but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional ( read : high ) profits .
2,3 ORG

The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two of their competitors , a buyout shop , and one of the savviest raiders around , is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something .

19,21 ORG|27,28 PER

They have many of the symptoms of a late - stage conglomerate : A gigantic main business with slowing growth , fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business , a shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock ( thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification ) , and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale .

The " Twin Deficits " Myth

2005 - 02 - 04T13:37:00 According to the usually reliable CNN / Money , the " Twin Deficits " will continue to grow .
10,11 ORG
10,11 ORG

Interesting terminology ... I believe they 're referring to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ?



When analyzing trade deficits , it 's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US .
26,27 PER|31,32 GPE
26,27 PER|31,32 GPE

So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers ( who control about 20 % of global GDP ) and everybody else ( excluding the non - consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global GDP ) .
13,14 GPE|14,15 PER|36,37 GPE|13,15 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity
13,14 GPE|14,15 PER|36,37 GPE|13,15 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity

Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number ?



Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods , the largest pressure on the deficit is that we 're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face .
4,5 GPE|26,27 GPE|36,37 GPE
4,5 GPE|26,27 GPE|36,37 GPE

And what about that other deficit ?



It , of course , is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes , but by borrowing funds .



And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia .
11,12 ORG|13,14 GPE|11,14 GEN-AFF.Org-Location
11,12 ORG|13,14 GPE|11,14 GEN-AFF.Org-Location

So , not to be a heretic , but 1 ) We 're issuing them at relatively low interest rates , 2 ) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually , and so 3 ) Would n't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non - US investors , rather than raising taxes in America ?
51,52 GPE|52,53 PER|59,60 GPE|51,53 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity
51,52 GPE|52,53 PER|59,60 GPE|51,53 GEN-AFF.Citizen-Resident-Religion-Ethnicity

It 's a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else being equal I 'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab .
23,24 GPE|25,26 ORG|23,26 GEN-AFF.Org-Location
23,24 GPE|25,26 ORG|23,26 GEN-AFF.Org-Location

The Twin Deficits are a reality , but they are n't exactly a terrifying one .

These insider sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal ( though the legal proof may be hard to come by ) but the solution is easy enough : They need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they 'll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back ( since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders ) , and there 's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court .

Southern states considering higher cigarette taxes ?

What 's notable in this debate , however , is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that " While North Carolina 's excise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . " Okay , okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that 's technically accurate .

But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and inasmuch as these penalties are n't assessed on a per - pack basis , they do n't -- they 're a lump - sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before .

However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way .

If all that you have read about this topic is an article in Business Week or The Wall Street Journal , you 've probably heard the standard answer-- the evidence is mixed .

13,15 ORG|17,20 ORG

That is true but not very revealing would n't you say ?



Evidence is mixed mostly because ( 1 ) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and ( 2 ) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together .
34,35 ORG

Social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced . There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime .

8,9 PER|25,26 WEA|34,35 PER

Yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion .

Companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform , as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers .

Market over reaction ?



Hard to say .



Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth .

Yesterday 's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies .
12,13 ORG
12,13 ORG

Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks .
8,9 ORG
8,9 ORG

I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday .



However , my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .



This may partially justify a higher P / E ratio .



A couple weeks ago , I observed that Wal - Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators .
8,11 ORG

Starbucks , on the other hand , has uniformly strong organizational indicators .

0,1 ORG

Not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators .
8,9 PER|11,12 PER
8,9 PER|11,12 PER

Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator .



In the past , several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues .
5,6 PER|13,14 ORG
5,6 PER|13,14 ORG

The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries .
8,9 ORG|18,19 ORG|8,19 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary
8,9 ORG|18,19 ORG|8,19 PART-WHOLE.Subsidiary

This is a strategic shift that has short - term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements .



Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis , several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues .
11,12 ORG
11,12 ORG

1 .



Starbucks has little debt .

Starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt .

4,5 ORG|18,19 PER

This option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future .

3 .



Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising .
0,1 ORG|4,5 ORG|7,8 FAC
0,1 ORG|4,5 ORG|7,8 FAC

While Starbucks does partner ( airlines , airports , Barnes & amp ; Noble ) , most of its stores are company owned .

1,2 ORG|5,6 ORG|7,8 FAC|9,14 ORG|19,20 FAC|21,22 ORG

From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures , product changes , and quality control .



Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .
11,12 ORG
11,12 ORG

I can not say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P / E ratio than the industry norm .



Risk is lower .



Interesting aside : Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme .

i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way .

what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition . and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?

but if you hold elections , you stop the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration .
